    "description": "This is the fourth time I'm writing about Stranger Things here, and since after almost a decade of following this show it has finally wrapped up, I think it's about time I formulate my thoughts a little more clearly.\nI've seen a lot of recent discourse around this show, and a lot of it is talking about how it has gone fully off the rails in season five. While I'm not going to say that's entirely untrue, it's really not thaaat bad, guys. To be honest, I even preferred it over season two because while it's not great, it's at least memorable. When this show first came out, it felt so fresh. To be fair, I was like ten when I saw the first season, so just about everything was fresh; however, even now I still think it holds up. It had a great premise that was easy to follow but still had a mysterious air to it that built upon. This is something only possible to be done so well with the great foundation they had set up of a very likeable main cast of kid actors and a great supporting cast of older teens, even if most of them have changed pretty significantly since the first season. The show even gave me 80s nostalgia, and I was born two decades after the 80s. I also quite enjoyed the way the show used horror; the entire starting sequence and Nancy's first time in the Upside Down are absolutely unforgettable. The smaller scope this season had helped the story feel compact; the characters felt believable, and had it ended here, it'd probably have been one of the best shows ever made. However, Netflix execs must've had big dollar signs in their eyes when they found out how many people watched it and gave the Duffer Brothers as much money as they needed to keep this going. Usually that's a bad idea, but I'm actually happy that was the case because that led to my beloved season three coming into existence.\nAfter season one, you could definitely feel that Stranger Things knew just how popular it was. The budget was higher, and that meant no more shoddy green screening or needing to hide demogorgons in darkness. On top of that, they seemed to understand the pull they had and that they could write longer-running stories spanning between seasons. However, there were some growing pains that came with Stranger Things's growth. The creators seemed to get a little overzealous in expanding the world and caused much of the second season to feel disjointed. The infamous “The Lost Sister” episode comes to mind, but this problem was apparent throughout the entire season. Compared to the carefully crafted first season, they seemed a lot more heavy-handed in revealing new settings, which really damaged the small-town vibe they were trying to build up to this point. Despite this, season two made some pretty brilliant choices, especially near the end, like the escaping of the Hawkins lab sequence. The tension of watching a relatively disposable but likeable character like Bob navigate the really sick overrun lab was so incredible and a high for the show. I'm still pissed off at how Bob died, though. How did he not think they could break through doors?\nThe upward trajectory near the end of season two only continued into my favourite season of the series, season three. It introduces my favourite character, Robin, pushes that cunt Mike to the side and reins in the show's scope, which really helped make the story feel focused. This choice also helped with pacing, which was actually good this time, unlike season two, where they made the brave choice to add a random throwaway arc of Eleven going goth. It felt like season three embraced some of the more over-the-top, colourful aspects of some 80s media, and while it certainly made it less believable of a show, Steve got to yell at a young girl about dying in a Russian elevator because she wants to drink bright green goop, so it was probably worth it. The flesh Mindflayer was sick as hell; the hospital fight was too, as well as the mirror maze fight. They even made Billy slightly likeable (though it did weird me out how people forgave him online instantly). Like, this guy is a racist who tried to hit a group of kids with a car. Chill out a little. My only actual issues are that Will, who has been a pretty central character until this point, is put on the sidelines and that the two plots feel too disconnected. I'd also have loved if there was less of knockoff Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nSeason four was when I felt like the show began buckling under its ever-growing weight. It wasn't a terrible season; I liked how they gave Lucas a larger role; I liked Argyle and Jonathan's slapstick much of the time. There were a couple sweet scenes between Jonathan and Will, which really let Noah Schnapp show off his acting chops despite Will being sidelined for most of this season. Vecna is a great villain too, even if he didn't look so menacing if you could see his torso. Unfortunately, this show's pattern of adding a loveable character just to kill them made me instantly peg Eddie as dying, so I could never get emotionally invested in him like I did with Alexei and Bob, despite him having way more screen time than them. His death was pretty stupid too. He really had no reason to kill himself there, and he didn't even really help anyone by doing that. I appreciate Steve commenting on it in season five though, but that just improved Steve's character, not Eddie's. I guess it could've been Eddie realising he'll just live the rest of his life on the run even if he made it out, but I still didn't love it. It felt cheap. This season also, bizarrely, had a road trip. It didn't help that I still didn't like Mike this season, and the Russians are getting pretty tiring by this point. It did like Yuri though. The scene at Susie's house was a super jarring choice too because it fully just felt like a different show. I'm not sure what vibe they were trying to go with, but it can't have been that.\nThe last season of Stranger Things was, to be honest, pretty weak, but that doesn't mean it was bad. I'll talk about the good at the end, but first I'm going to rattle off some of my scattered thoughts on what I didn't like. Everyone this season talks like they're in a movie trailer and spend too much time explaining things to the audience. I'd have preferred if they'd just let some things speak for themselves. Let my mind and the insane visuals do the heavy lifting. I'd also have preferred to have never found out what was in the scientist's briefcase that gave Vecna his magic. It didn't help that despite this season being long as hell, they also somehow still don't have enough time in each episode and cut conversations unnaturally, like some sort of YouTube Short. Maybe if they'd killed off a few more characters earlier, they wouldn't have this issue. Characters like Murray and Robin got kind of flanderised, and to be honest, Murray should've disappeared after season three, as his story with Alexei felt like a natural conclusion for his character. They've just kept him in to say random silly lines, and Robin doesn't have half the charm she's had until this point this season. I could've done without ever seeing Eleven's sister again too, as well as Hopper, who should've died in season three, and Mr Clark, who only seemed to return for fan service. They could've also pretty easily killed Mike's parents as well, and honestly, it'd have made more sense because what are the odds you survive a demogorgon attack, but I guess they might've wanted to avoid piling on Mike further. They probably shouldn't have shown his parents getting attacked by the demogorgons at all because this season the demogorgons are in a weird state of being both weak and strong. When they're up against normal people, they're actual monsters, but if it's a main character, all bets are off. Why could Mike's mum stand up to a demogorgon? Why did the demodogs attack soldiers but not Robin and Vicky? Why did the demogorgons wait long enough for Will to use his powers to attack? We'll never know, I guess. The CGI did not help the situation either. How did the demogorgons somehow look worse despite a budget of half a billion dollars? These fuckers looked like Play-Doh during the first couple of episodes. The CGI for the white sludge liquid Nancy and Jonathan almost drowned in was pretty bad too; it looked like some shitty Blender liquid preset. At least the Vecna CGI was an improvement; the flesh monster looked sick too. Story-wise, I thought it was also an odd choice to overcomplicate the Upside Down further. I was pretty fine with Henry just being able to do magic; I didn't need an explanation. There was also good in this season though. I appreciated that they gave Will a more active role, especially because, again, Noah Schnapp is a really great actor even if they kind of dragged the whole him coming out and picked the worst time for it. I also really liked the conflict between Steve and Dustin; it felt pretty natural considering how they were kind of just going through the motions last season, and the performances of Gaten Matarazzo and Joe Keery really sell their scenes together. I really hope to see them in more stuff after Stranger Things. The same goes for Nancy and Jonathan; that scene when they thought they were about to like drown in white goop was genuinely pretty emotional, and their breakup felt really natural and was the best possible way to wrap up their story. I think it'd have been completely against Nancy's character for them to stay together at that point after the events of seasons three and four. Jamie Campbell Bower also continues to do great both as Vecna and Mr Whatsit, with one of the best performances of this entire show. The actors playing Holly and Derek do a great job, especially considering their actors' ages, and Derek steals the show every time he's on scene. Stranger Things felt like it wrapped itself up pretty well too, and Eleven dying to Purple Rain was unexpected but a great choice. I'm pretty sure she's actually dead, and Mike's story was just wishful thinking. If she's really alive, that'd be an awful choice and completely undercut the ending, so I hope they don't prove me wrong with some spinoff. The way the show ended with a new group of kids playing DND in Mike's basement was pretty sweet. They even played the (proper) Heroes for the final credits, which was fire."

    "description": "No, this is not a joke. I was recommended this rather vehemently by someone who previously had been given decent recommendations, and even then, it did take some convincing after I heard the title. They'd sold it to me as sort of a Masturbation Master Kurosawa, where the title is somewhat deceitful and it's actually a really well-done romance manga. After reading 40 chapters of this, I've come to realise it's a pretty unremarkable romance manga that doubles as porn with one of the most batshit premises ever put to paper. Before I get to screaming into space about it though, I'll talk about the positives.\nThe art is, I think, above average. The characters, especially Shion, are always pretty emotive, and I found it charming. I also think in general Shion and his friend group look unique enough. Usually josei has pretty good art, but it felt a little different here, as for some reason, this manga presents itself as a more innocent shojo-esque romance, which kind of makes them fucking even more jarring. It's not super unexpected, I guess; they're both horndogs, but with everyone blushing and giggling, smash-cutting into full-blown sex scenes was a little odd to me even if it's cute sometimes. Also this censoring is doing literally nothing lmao. I don't even know what the point of it is. Like, ok, this guy is penetrating him with a mystery white cylinder. How inconspicuous. The other thing I can praise it for (I guess) is that I've read yaoi, and I've read yuri, but I've never read a bisexual romance manga. Not that I really care if bisexual people are getting awareness or not; fuckers just get the best of both worlds. But because of this, I feel like they really shrink any gooner audience they could've gotten because if you're straight or gay, you're only really going to like it half of the time. At that point it'd have made more sense to have just made this have no porn aspect at all so normal people might feel inclined to give it a shot, but idk, I guess the author is just a freak. I am at least pleased that Shion's love interest is canonically bisexual because it'd have been even weirder if he was straight.\nNow for the bad, the characters aside from Shion and his BF(F) are basically nothing and are so forgettable. I do remember the doctor at least because is it not really weird how he wanted to go out with his ~19 year old patient while being 30? Rui was valid for hating him. I also have to talk about this whole premise, and if you were not loving how graphic I had already gotten in the previous paragraph, please close this right now because it's going to get quite batshit from here. Ok, so the idea is that this guy turns into a girl every time he cums but back into a man every time he is cum inside as a girl. It also seems to happen somewhat at random after the prerequisite has been done, but I had to get out of there before it was explained. This is only an issue because Shion and Rui are seemingly both sex addicts, and this guy cannot go three days without cumming and becoming a woman. I get that they can't just become monks or whatever, but if you're trying to avoid telling people about your situation, maybe don't fuck on the first night of your vacation... One last thing before I finish this off and forget about it until someone brings it up and has a really awkward conversation about it (if you're reading this, Tommy, don't bother me about this, I swear to god), what happens if the love interest's dick is still inside when the MC transforms from a girl into a guy? Would he get pushed out, or would they fuse together like some kind of even more fucked-up conjoined twin/human centipede situation?\nNote: If you're wondering why this isn't in the RSS feed, I was told in no uncertain terms that I'd be banned from the Nekoweb RSS feed if I put this up on there. Sorry about that for the one person who gets updates via RSS."

    "description": "I'll get this out of the way right away: I'm not sure if this is even the album I wanted to listen to or if there was some mistake with Spotify or what, so do take this all with a grain of salt. I went in looking for \"Blossom Tea Time\" and I found \"Blossom Dream Cafe\" which sounded about right and had the banger \"Whispering Flower\" on it, so it seemed right, but it was also 11 songs longer than the version on Bandcamp and no, I'm never listening to anything on Bandcamp the woke left cannot make me. What I can best assume happened after a single look at the (attached) cover is that this is a combination of both Blossom Tea Time and their other album \"Dreamścape\" so do take any of the criticism about disjointedness with, like, a whole salt shaker's worth of salt.\nRegardless of what it took to get here, this is a pretty cute jazz (adjacent at least) lounge album. I was a little concerned at first, as the first few songs were pretty slow, even for a jazz album, but by track six I felt that this album had really started to hit its stride and follows into the track \"Blossom tea time\" which is probably my favourite on the album. It feels like it forgoes all the gentle mellow vibes it had and gets really fun and almost jazz-pop-esque and perhaps even has some more electronic leanings. I can't explain this one; it really gives off the vibe of a cartoon character in the 80s walking down the street cheerily greeting their neighbours as well as giving off similar vibes to some of Pikuniku's music, though a little more toned down. I really quite liked the vocal chop (??) \"hah \" kind of sound too; it felt like it broke up some of the repetition in the track. I can't say for sure how a song that feels like this drastic a change of pace from the more mellow but sweet, upbeat kind of ambience the album seemed to have until this point affects the whole album's cohesion, but I feel like that was already thrown out the window when they slammed two albums into one. Even if cohesiveness was a concern, I feel like it should always take a backseat for a song this good because trust me, I locked the fuck back in on listening to this album after hearing this.\nAfter that kind of turning point, there still aren't any songs quite as good as Blossom tea time but there is a notable markup in songs that I found more engaging as the album becomes a little more active, though in my opinion it does go a little far with this approach in songs like Madeleine, where I thought it started getting a little silly with it. The initial part of that song is pretty fine, but by about a minute or so I started thinking, \"Ok, we're getting a little too silly with it now\". It was a pleasant track, sure, but it just didn't feel like it fit, even less so than Blossom tea time to me, and it didn't really get to use the same excuse of reinvigorating this album and being extra unique, as much of Madeline's cues seem to be taken directly from Blossom tea time. I mean, it has the vocal chop, vibe and even the same kind of beat with a slightly slower tempo; just listen to the start of both. I don't know if this is common in jazz; I'm not a super big listener, to be honest, but it still just felt like I was hearing the same thing over, just in a less interesting way now. It made it even weirder how the energy of this album immediately seems to nosedive into a generally far more mellow vibe, reaching its lowest point in the sweet but not exactly hopeful \"Water lily\". I'm happy it's followed by the certainly much more enthusiastic \"Whispering Flowers\" and \"Five flavor berry\" though to be honest I'd have preferred this to end with Whispering Flowers as it felt like it had a wider range and kind of encapsulated this album better than Five flavor berry that, while I really liked the piano riff it had going on, felt much more standalone in a way. I also just really like the birds tweeting in Whispering Flowers, it's very cute.\nThere are also some (even) slower songs like the piano-centric ballad \"Dreamścape: Glow\" which I felt like is being really overlooked, having on 10k streams on Spotify. It begins a series of piano reprise's of earlier songs on the album which I thought were all just as good or even better than their original songs. I'm fairly sure these are more like bonus tracks so I counted Five flavor berry as the actual ending to this album as these songs randomly backloaded in the end wouldn't really make much sense to me."

    "description": "I put this on my top 10 albums of 2025 list but somehow managed to forget to write anything about it, classic blunder. LUX stood out a lot to me a lot because it sounds so fucking over the top and grand and pulls it off so well (generally speaking). The last time I heard something like this was probably with some of the tracks in Sometimes I Might Be Introvert which was quite some time ago now so it was cool to see this and watch it become as big as it is. When this album goes all in on the grandness it produces some of the best songs of the year like Berghain which has an intense, ethereal opera sound to it and when Bjork comes in as a bird you know shit's getting real. Unfortunately I didn't much like the ending, had Yves Tumor been excluded it'd have played much better even if the deer crying blood was some metal ass imagery. Unfortunately this album has the strangely common problem of starting off with a bang and then slowly tapering off as it goes on, it definitely could've been worse as it's a fairly long bang but once I reached the last five or so tracks I can't say there was all that much memorable about them, not even Memória. They weren't bad by any stretch of the imagination but certainly didn't feel, to me at least, as essential to the album as the rest of the tracks. La Yugular for example is even pretty great, but after the all you can eat buffet of sounds and ideas ROSALÍA had been feeding my up to that point it didn't stand out as much as it should've to me because it felt like she was just doing things she'd already done earlier (albeit perhaps better than before) again. There are also too many songs on this album that sound unique at the start but by the last 30 seconds become the same song that I felt like I'd heard over and over by that point, like it's not a bad way to end a song but when it happened more than twice it gets a little grating.\nTo stop complaining for a second, ROSALÍA has a great voice all the way through and there are points where my jaw unironically dropped, she's easily one of if not the best singers right now (at least in pop). I just wish there were more songs like Berghain and Sexo, Violencia y Llantas that stood out so strongly. Unrelated but it was really cool being able to understand her about 50% of the time when she was speaking Spanish. I am the Spanish goat, now I just gotta learn how to not look like an illiterate when I write it. Also sorry for not really giving examples, I don't feel like taking notes for 40 minutes, I got shit to do, please forgive me."

    "description": "Despite this being one of the first hiphop albums I listened to when I really started getting into music, it just hit me that I had completely forgotten to write anything down about it. When I started on this whole music thing I was a little overwhelmed so lots of my recommendations came from mainly Youtubers and I heard Fantano talking about this album in some list he made so I decided to give it a shot. Up to that point I'd only heard of this album in places where people spoke of it as if it was some sort of almost mythical creature, like you could categorise time as pre-Madvillainy and post-Madvillainy. I know I'm getting a little dramatic here but so were they leading to my expectations of this album being high to such a degree that no matter what it actually sounded like I'd have probably ended up disappointed, and unfortunately that's exactly what happened. It didn't help that up to that point the only full album I'd heard was IGOR which remains top five for me so my bar for what an album should be like had been set wayy too high. My disappointment could've also been because this is kind of more of an acquired taste than other stuff I'd listened to, I know this is far from being niche but it's also not particularly close to what my dad was listening to on the radio growing up.\nAnyways, I've danced around actually sharing what I think for long enough and I hope all that preamble will be enough to stop people from tearing me to pieces like the old lady in Weapons for giving this \"just\" a seven. I'd love to give it higher but even as I relisten to it today I still have lingering disappointment. Obviously that's out of Madlib and DOOM's hands but was still to the detriment of this project. Oops, guess I didn't get to the point after all. What they could control though was how much downtime I felt like this project had, the cartoon audio clips never did anything for me and just felt like they were slowing this thing down, so did the abundance of interlude tracks, I'm fine with one or two but this shit has ~6 (depending what you consider an interlude), it felt like I get to listen to two proper songs (which were always really good, don't get me wrong) before all the momentum was destroyed by a boring interlude. I know this is was pretty slow-paced album in the first place, this isn't any Femtanyl shit but holy fuck I cannot emphasise how much these interludes kills the mood. This album is also pretty front-loaded too, the first half has some absolute bangers like America's most Blunted, Curls and Accordion with just about every proper song apart from Rainbows being good but the second half really doesn't do that much for me, it has like Money Folder, Fancy Clown and All Caps but that's really about it for what I enjoyed. It also has Shadows of Tomorrow and what even is that song guys, are we so for real?\nI didn't really mean to do so much complaining, the beats and rapping on this thing were usually good but it just felt bloated to me despite being only 46 minutes long which is never a good sign, if it had been a little more to the point and got rid of those cartoon clips I'd have liked it a lot more."

    "description": "I saw a Kill Count of this come out and I was just going to let myself get spoiled but the premise sounded interesting and my lovely boy James convinced me to give this a shot. The cover (included in the media section) being sick as hell helped too.\nWhile the soundtrack of this film was nothing special in my opinion (though when it certainly had some ominous ambiance which fit well), the inclusion of Beware of Darkness for the beginning of the film as well as Under the Porch for the credits were both great picks for additional songs and might finally get me to listen to All Things Must Pass. As for the rest of the stuff going on in this film, it was quite the bizarre watch but I don't think the bizarre-ness made it bad per se.\nThe film is cut together in a really weird way with a bunch of different characters POVs, kind of like an anthology but it's just the same few days playing out again and again. I unfortunately think this choice ended up being to the film's detriment but it could've been worse, I appreciate that the later characters days are cut down if we've seen the same scene twice and it's a little interesting seeing how the situation changes depending on who we're seeing the perspective of. Despite these choice however, it was still pretty annoying especially when generally the switch between views happens just when something interesting is happening but I digress. Now it's time to talk about the characters, if anything the characters in this film are bold, they make sure I won't forget them for better or for worse. I kind of hated Justine at first, I had thought she was pretty unforgivable when she successfully convinced a recovering alcoholic to get drunk with her but she grew on me slightly especially as I found out Paul also sucks (though honestly hitting that James kid for having a random needle in his pocket was valid as shit, I'm just mad about him cheating on his wife). It felt like an insanely stupid choice for her to follow the one kid that didn't go missing considering her situation, like everyone thinks you were involved so this is just about the worst look you could have. I liked Archer perhaps a little more than I should've, he doesn't exactly seem like a good guy, he's a real dick to Justine despite having no actual evidence she was the reason the kids went missing and he even ended up being wrong, but it's very easy to sympathise with him a lot more than most of the other characters at least. He even has a bit of a redemption arc because even though he's an asshole to Justine he still protects her despite still being convinced (I think) she's the reason his son is missing. Him and Justine's relationship is pretty cool too especially because it means the movie finally picks up its pace a little. The scene where he tells his dream son he loves him only for the kid to turn into the scary clown lady Gladys is sweet and also got me good (even if later on we learn his son is the worst to my lovely boy Alex). Next up is the classic crackhead character James. I find him really funny and the scene of him getting chased out of Alex's house is probably my favourite in the film, shits proper spooky and tense because honestly I thought he was more likely than not going to be killed off there when I first saw it. Following James' section is Marcus' who manages to be probably my favourite character in this entire movie despite having about the least time on screen out of any of the other people we saw the perspective of (I didn't count it just felt like it). I feel like as far as people in this movie go he's probably the one that's done the least wrong, I mean sometimes he's a little mean to Justine but I think he's just trying to help her and himself, and yet we have to watch as he's forced to brutally kill his own husband before he himself gets offed. Shit's fucked up. Alex is the final character we get the POV of (if I'm remembering correctly) and I quite liked his character but I was more impressed by his actor. He's played by Cary Christopher who is apparently ten years old and yet he's still better than many adult actors. You also really do feel horrified watching Gladys force this kid to do what she wants and watching him needing to look after his parents. For sure wouldn't have hit the same if they didn't have an actor this young and he did a great job.\nThe actual story of this film is alright, the villain just being some mind-controlling witch lady was a bit of a let down though. I don't know, I just kind of expected something more otherworldly doing something cooler than just sapping the youth from the kids or whatever. The payoff to the mystery was satisfying though so it wasn't all bad even if it took a really long time to get around to it, however the actual conclusion to the film wasn't super satisfying to me. This film is also apparently a dark comedy but most of that didn't land at all for me so I'm just not gonna worry about it...\nI'm a teensy bit nervous to talk about how film is shot as the only thing I know about the making of films was taught in year 11 English but I'm gonna give it my best shot anyhow because the choices the director takes for filming scenes is often really unique and cool (or maybe it's really common and I don't watch enough horror movies who's to say). I especially like how they often seem to mount the camera on things like the front of Paul's car and the door at Alex's house, makes the scenes feel a lot more intense without needing the camera to get shaky to the point that I don't even know what's happening like some controlled chaos type shit. The way zooms are used to build tension are also really cool and it's not often I see movies directed by people with enough balls to make zooms in quite this slow, I was watching this with three other guys and we all got dead silent about ten seconds into the zoom in onto the house. I will say the fight scenes could've been more interesting, the way the camera falls as James' head falls when Justine shoots him is sick as hell though. So is Gladys' death which might be the most metal thing ever broadcasted and made me wince a little watching it. My only big issue with how this film was shot was that some scenes were just too dark for me to see, partly my monitor's fault I'm sure but I'm sure something could've been done on the filmmaker's side.\nEdit: I really undersold the soundtrack, I'm listening to it while making some edits on this because I must've wrote it in a trance last time with how many mistakes there were and it's really god damn good. I'm sure I was a little mean to it because it was never really the focus of the film but wow it's spooky all by itself and Newspaper had a jumpscare inside of the song. I love the scratchy violin noises even if it's not a super unique choice for a horror movie and I love the building dread the soundtrack creates with some of its songs despite an album certainly not being the intended way to consume it."

    "description": "Ice Lamp never felt like it would be anything more than a basic shojo manhwa but I was looking to gulp down some slop and I guess it did its job in that department but don't expect for that to stop me from complaining. It definitely tries its best to fit in everything it wants to say within its surprisingly short 74 chapters but I think it does flounder a bit. To me up until near the end of season 2 it felt as if the author assumed they'd have a lot more time to tell their story but sometime around the timeskip they realised, fuck, we have 20 chapters to tell 60% of what we want, leading to lots of strange moments and forgotten plotlines. The whole bit about Kira's mother really shouldn't have been included at all because its told and then paid of within like five chapters so when we find out that one guy (forgot his name) killed her mum it wasn't really some big ahah moment because I really didn't have time to ruminate on Kira's mother being some genius commoner or whatever. I also found that much of Mufi's actions confused me, maybe I'm just a little dumb but I really don't have a clue as to why he was being a dick to Kira for a while. I also found it gross that Kira seemed to have a crush on him for a while when he was introduced as a big brother character (not that he did much big-brotherly activities) and it didn't even matter because that whole plot was cut off and Kira never ended up with anyone. I have to assume Mufi ended up with that noble lady but I can't know for sure because she disappeared immediately after being introduced as she was just a way to push along some pointless drama. The whole supernatural element was never really paid off either, I had almost forgotten about it and it seemed the author did too because right at the end it was suddenly like, \"oh yeah and there's a dragon that hatched from your head thanks bye\" and that is just about as much explanation as you get. I was a little pissed off when a huge point, her pretending to be a man, was just kind of brushed off. It was really weird, to me at least, that nobody even seemed to care about that. They also just randomly kill the king in like a three chapter span and then get away with no consequences but that's neither here nor there. The art is pretty middle of the road but the fights at least are slightly above average for shojo at least so that's cool I guess. This whole write-up is a mess, the story was a mess, I'm writing this while watching Weapons so I really just don't care. Sorry to the single Ice Lamp fan."

    "description": "SPOILERS FOR OUTER WILDS (as always but apparently Outer Wilds fans kill you if you don't explicitly mark spoilers)\nIt's cool but it really started to drag a little near the end, especially when it came to solving puzzles but I'll start with the good first. I really liked the exploration, flying about in my ship felt fum and my fist five or so trips to every planet was always a good time especially because the content in this game is compact it feels like you're always finding something new. This was also a super unique way to tell the story in a way that links reading the story directly to being able to figure out how to compress in the game. That and the story just being really engaging and the writing being quirky and funny (in a good way) kept me interested in the whole \"what happened to the Nomai people\" question all the way up until I found out (though it wasn't too hard to guess). I also love Gabbro even if he got me killed the first time we met. The music is also just incredible, like I'm not exaggerating when I say this is top 3 video game OSTs of all time. The ending was also very sweet (as sweet as an ending that kills everyone you know can be) and the whole \"this song is new to me, but I'm honoured to be a part of it\" has snuck its way into my head since I finished this game about a week ago now.\nNow for the bad (imo don't kill me). The whole timeloop thing gets tedious for me, I get that without it you don't actually have a game and the story would be ruined but that doesn't change the fact that its just annoying to do the same thing over and over again. I also really didn't enjoy needing to watch what I did in the last run, like it lasted 20 minutes max I haven't forgotten. This issue is compounded by the sometimes very clunky feeling movement of my player character and the way sometimes my ship lands unpredictably, both of these are 100% skill issues but it doesn't really change the fact that it's a pain when something wholly unrelated to what I felt was in my control killed a run and I have to go through the same go up the elevator, get in the ship, go to the planet bit all over again. There were also just a few puzzles that really didn't connect at all for me, for example the one where you have to wait for the planet to fall into the black whole to get inside that building didn't click until I finally gave up and Googled after spending real life hours trying to leap in. It sounds dumb in retrospect but when I was playing I just really didn't even consider such a thing. There are also some puzzles like getting to the North Pole on the quantum moon that really pissed me off (despite actually getting onto the quantum moon being one of the coolest experienced I had in this game). I knew how to do the puzzle but turning off the lights and opening the door over and over again until I finally made it felt like such a waste of time. Maybe I was doing something wrong but with the time pressure of the run ending it was pretty stressful and even once I made it the whole side-quest I just put myself through felt very disconnected from the rest of the game with the only reward being a dinner with Jay-Z. Last thing that pissed me off was those angler fish guys, I was not aware they killed you only if you made too much sound until I finished the game and watched a video of someone else doing it. Can't believe I died so many times to those guys."

    "description": "DISCLAIMER: This is based on watching the first episode of this 7 season long show. Usually I watch at least a season before even considering having an opinion on a show but holy shit this was the worst episode I have ever seen in my life and there's no chance I'll make it through 12 more episodes but I still want to talk some shit. First off the good because the .5 has to come from somewhere. The premise of this show was mildly interesting to me as I usually don't watch post-apocalyptic shows despite being quite interested in them, even if I had a sneaking suspicion it was an excuse to have some weird sex shit with a bunch of teens in the woods like Yellowjackets if it was bad but I guess I couldn't even get through enough to find out (though with how quick they were to get the pants off that one girl I wouldn't be surprised). The setting was also just really good (nature, not the awful set for the space station or set), it was really vibrant and overgrown which seemed like what they were going for. I also liked knockoff Rodrick and the Asian guy's interactions with each other, they were just about the only pair that had chemistry (bdum tss, because they're like space stoners) except for the part where the Asian guy is like \"note to self, next time save the girl\" because it made me want to blow my brains out.\nAlright, now to the bad. Why the fuck are these three so hot? I never thought I'd be the one to complain about something like this but look at that image I've attached and tell me those three look like they were just taken out of prison only to get into a spaceship that crashed into Earth. Just put a bit of dirt on them, take a bit of makeup off and mess their hair up a little pretty please, it felt so stupid. Next, I thought the line delivery felt stilted, especially when delivered by the main girl and with the general lack of chemistry exception the one exception from earlier it was only made worse. It also made it almost painful to watch their exposition especially when I felt like the writing wasn't too terrible for it, it wasn't great but if the actors were at all good I think it would've been pretty passable. I shouldn't put too much praise on the writers though because some of this writing really pissed me off. When the male lead (I assume) calls the female lead princess I wanted to throw my monitor through my window because holy shit I've seen this exact guy and dynamic so many time's it's frankly insane and it's never interesting. Same goes for the female lead, when she was like \"before you get any ideas I don't care\" I was surprised the other girl didn't sock her in the face because that is the laziest comeback of all time and nobody is buying that she doesn't care because there's an 100% chance she'll decide that she does care and her and whoever she's going to end up with will have some sort of moment (my bets are on the guy with the long hair that called her princess). The whole story seems pretty alright but I do find it hard to believe that someone was able to get onboard this ship, like was there any security at all? I get they had to get the kids inside in a rush but still. The music picks were also just really bad, I don't know what to say about that though. Anyhow that's it from me. I'm very slightly morbidly curious as to see how this show goes but unfortunately I don't have an endless supply of free time so I won't spend it all on a show as bad is this. I just hope Rodrick ends up with the girl he likes.\nWait holy fuck it actually was Rodrick."

    "description": "Don't have much to say about this one, I hold off giving it a 7 because I can't say it's good with a straight face but it's certainly fun and undeserving of a 5.9 on IMDB especially when put up against the show I'm about to write my thoughts on (though I suppose if you're looking at the grid it'll be before this one). Anyways time to get back on topic, Spree is a horror (??) comedy starring Steve from Stranger Things who kind of feels like he's all over the place these days working on a successful career as an actor and another successful career as a musician with his album of this year gradually pushing its way into my top 10. He's my favourite part of this film aside from maybe Bobby who is just some influencer guy and his \"pranking the homeless\" bit was the funniest shit I've seen in quite some time. It was also pretty cool to find out he's the guy from that I'm Jared, I'm 19 and I never fucking learnt how to read Vine.\nWatching this film as more of a Kay and Peele style skit was probably the right choice as I doubt I'd be able to take it seriously, Steve's (no I don't know his name) character Kurt is just not believable and that's probably purposeful because if he was the comedy wouldn't have landed at all and it'd have been a really fucked up movie. It'd also make it really quite bizarre how this guy was getting away with this for so long when he's literally streaming his crimes had this world worked on normal logic. This movie also did the best impression of the internet though I think they couldn't cranked up the cynicism a little further to be honest. I don't envy whoever had to write those Twitch chat messages, I had expected them to just be repeating nonsense but after pausing in a few spots they all seemed to be actually be written for the scene which was pretty cool.\nHowever, it's because this film had such a nonsensical tone that some parts, especially those that were trying to do social commentary on how like the internet is ruining our lives and shit didn't really land for me. I think the movie would be better off just being dumb fun with that idea just being in the background instead of being said to me like I'm too stupid to pick on it otherwise, especially because Kurt is so over the top in his quest to get famous that it's almost impossible to avoid. This film also reminded me of the Christchurch Mosque Shootings which was no doubt accidental but still killed my mood a little."

    "description": "Oops, forgot to rate one of my favourite albums of 2025. Classic. When I first saw people start to talk about this album I actively avoided it, not for any logical reasons but because I thought the cover looked like the album would be ambient, it's not bad at all but it just kind of gave off that vibe to me. Anyways, after I finally gave this album a chance I discovered that it was absolutely incredible, especially for a debut album. A lot of it reminded me of BCNR but not in a cheap knockoff way like Plan 75 or La Brea, this for sure felt like its own thing taking a more sombre tone than those two and in my opinion being a better BCNR album than the album BCNR themselves released this year. Not exactly an original opinion based on what I've read online but still. This album also isn't afraid to make somewhat bizarre choices like how Seyburn is basically just one guy with a guitar and I think that choice paid off as Seyburn is a very sweet song with an atmosphere that continues to become more and more relaxed until you're jolted awake with Your Old Place, the best song on this album (but I'll talk more about it later). The whole album feels like it's in constant flux with explosive highs and mellow lows throughout its almost hour long playtime. While I'd love to say that it's the perfect length, I just don't think it is, one of this album's biggest weaknesses for me is that it's just a little too long, had it been maybe ten minutes shorter it would've been a 9 or even 9.5 for me, but tracks 5 through 7 just don't do anything for me at all. Maybe they'll grow on me, seems like other people like them more than Heavy Red or Seyburn at least which kind of baffles me as Seyburn at least is one of my most listened to songs on this album, it feels so cosy and personal even if the subject-matter is sad (I think, Genius is really letting me down on this song though I'm pretty sure it's about Emily's death which is tying this whole project together though it could also just be about the writer and Emily breaking up which I hope is the case).\nNow to get a little more back on track I'll talk about tracks 8 through 13 which I think is one of the most impressive run of songs in any album I've ever heard and even rivalling Geese's final four on Getting Killed which is their main competitor for my AOTY in my mind. The way it climbed to peak on Outlast then plummeted back down in 34th Floor (no I didn't mean for that to sound like a joke) with the sombre vibes continuing until it ends on Your Old Place which remains atmospheric and sombre but slowly builds into a point where the instrumental is even starting to clip (though that could always just be my headset or Spotify being bad however I really like it). Your Old Place is such a great way to end an album and the way it ends without fading out reminds me of the way Getting Killed ends so bombastically with Long Island City Here I Come however that ending made it sound like I was flying into the sun while this is certainly more grounded. Anyways it's getting really late and I don't even know what I'm writing any more, this whole thing was even more off the cuff than most of these thoughts. Sorry I compared it to Geese so much but Getting Killed, Revengeseekerz and this were my most listened to albums this year and it's a little difficult to compare an album like this to Revengeseekerz. Also if you're pissed off about me putting this in a category with other BCNR adjacent albums just listen to the first minute or so of the first song and tell me they don't give off BCNR vibes."

    "description": "Is this game's story good? Yes (generally). Does this game look good? Yes (generally). Is the atmosphere good? Is the world unique? Yes to both. Now, after saying all this, you can imagine just how catastrophically the gameplay fails for me to give it only a five. Had the gameplay even been mediocre this would've been more like a 9 but the combat is so mind-numbingly awful I had to struggle to keep playing this. The story only just barely kept me going. Remember this coming from someone with over 1000 hours in Hypixel Skyblock so I hope my words have a little weight when I say the gameplay is bad if I'm a man who can mine glass for 300 hours.\nFirst I'll talk about the good parts before we get into the parts that'll get me death threats. Like I said earlier, the story and characters are really good and probably the best to be released this year. I'd even go as far as to argue that this game's story is the best of any game ever released if I may be so bold. It's pretty unique, exciting and the way this game always seemed to titillate me with a new reveal was the only reason I made it through.\nTo be bold once more but in the other direction however, saying it has the best story out of any game isn't really saying too much as out of all the stories I've ever experienced, I doubt it would crack even the top 50 and I basically exclusively read slop at this point. Game stories are just really bad in general however, so this 7.5/10 story really feels 10/10 here. The prologue really does feel like a 10/10 story though, Kirsty Rider, the voice of Lune especially does insanely well (which is why it's so unfortunate that Lune is so lacking in good moments) and Gustave is a character I felt instantly interested in with his great introduction. The mysterious man on the beach is just the cherry on top. A little later you meet Maelle (for the second time I guess but she joins your party this time) who I care less about than Gustave or Lune and then every other character who joins your party after Maelle I just don't give a damn about at all. I'm sure if I could be bothered to hang out with the cast in camp I'd have learnt more about them and thereby found them more interesting but you cannot just show me a mystery like \"who is the man on the beach\" and then be like \"why don't you hang out at camp for a while?\" It felt like the writing really started to fall by the wayside the longer the game went for and lacked any interesting character moments the first few hours provided me with (in the main story at least). And to top it off I wasn't even all that satisfied with the reveal of who the man at the beach was which just about sucked out any of the interest I had remaining for this game. I know I sounded pretty negative here but the main story was, for the most part, good. At least the music never let me down. It's incredible, it's grand, orchestral and always fits the scene, bumping up the atmosphere to a new level. The vocals in it do more than I'd expect them to as well. It's no surprise to me it topped the Billboard Classical chart.\nNext up, graphics. This is something I'm less positive about. Obviously if you have eyes you can tell the game looks good but it also doesn't look all that visually distinct or interesting. It looks a little too much like a generic Unreal Engine 5 game and the fact that it won the award for best art direction made me lose my shit because out of all the nominees it was easily the worst in that department. Again, the game doesn't look bad, it's certainly good at showing off spectacle but it didn't blow me away.\nNow the bad, firstly this game's optimisation was absolutely abysmal. There is no reason on God's green Earth that this game should be running worse than Elden Ring, RDR2, Hogwarts Legacy, The Witcher 3 or even Cyberpunk on my hardware when it looks worse than all of those games and also isn't open world. I cannot fathom how the performance could possibly be this piss poor to the point I'm not getting 60FPS even on the lowest settings. I don't have a 5090 or whatever but even then just in comparison to those games it doesn't make any sense to me how this game could run this badly. Next, the real issue with this game was how god awful the gameplay is. I'm not a fan of turn based games at all which is why is was initially wary of this game, but after spending months listening to people talking about how \"innovative\" this game is on the JRPG formula and testimonials from people who had sworn off playing any JRPG after their grandmother had died playing Pokemon and E33 brought her back to life I finally caved and bought it. But do you know the giant innovation this game made? It's just that you can dodge and parry. Except dodging is never better than parrying so really you can only parry. Stupidest thing I've ever seen. This means instead of doing one thing in every fight like traditional JRPGs, you end up doing two things now. Obviously an improvement but not enough to make this genre fun to me so if this game changed anyone's mind about JRPGs I just have to assume they played the worst JRPG ever a single time and then swore them off forever without realising they never really disliked JRPGs. If you intend to scream at me about elemental weaknesses and shit just wait a minute because that's my next point. This game is terribly balanced. Weapons, they're alright, but Pictos are insane. When I first started the game Lune had Immolation which was a fire move so I decked her out with fire and damage buffing Pictos. This snowballed to the point that, by the time I had unlocked the Hell skill every other character in my team had become support and the moment I cast the spell every enemy on the screen turned into dust (a little exaggerated but it was pretty OP). I could've nerfed myself or played expert mode, but first off I completely forgot there were even difficulty options in this game after setting mine to their expedition mode (that's my bad), but also nerfing myself just isn't fun, it's unsatisfying and really shouldn't be my job. This whole balancing segment is pretty opinion based, I'm well aware and it is partially my fault but still I think they could've done a better job with it and also relayed to me in more detail what expert mode was because I had assumed it'd be like Terraria where for my first playthrough (with two people mind you) I was still getting bodied by every boss. If I had played Terraria's expert mode off the bat I would've blown my brains out because as it suggests it's for people that are pretty familiar with the game when in Expedition 33 I guess it just isn't... This was all the case before I got to Act 3 however where E33 decides to go balls off the wall difficulty-wise to the point of making it frustrating to play. Again I could've just changed the difficulty however that's an even more unsatisfying feeling than nerfing myself. Simon was one of the most brutal experiences I've had playing any game and after about four or five hours I finally took that fucker down and it wasn't even all that satisfying... Anyways that's my take on Expedition 33, feel free to chalk this up to me being a butthurt Silksong fanboy because that's just facts. I'd have written more but I've used up just about all my hater energy at this point.\nForgot to mention how they made a Deluxe Edition Upgrade for $17.50 (NZD) and it went overwhelmingly positive on steam when all it adds are outfits. Lets be real for a second, if this was any other game that shit's going to be rated mixed at best, that's some real glaze if I've ever seen it and it just felt greedy to me.\nEdit: I just watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls4QS3F8rJU and while generally I agree with the points he's making, I can't help but feel like this guy is a grifter. In this video he talked big about all these things so I Googled Threat Interactive to see what they made as it must be impressive but it seems not only have they never made anything but it seems like Threat Interactive is just one guy so it's a little sketchy especially when he's asking for 900K on his website. He says he's going to unveil his game prototype but who knows if that'll ever come (also his website looks god awful). It's also just really hard not to get second hand embarrassment watching this guy talk like he's a way bigger deal than he is, as if a company as big as Epic Games would ever care what he says even if he gets 10x as many subscribers lol."

What kind of random ass maid would ever have this much free time, why would they immediately be able to meet the very secretive master of the castle and why would they have such expensive clothes?? This fucking guy sucks at 20 questions and all the way up until the far too drawn out reveal I was pissed off. I also gotta say, the way things are figured out make me feel stupid for even bothering to read this. Like the way Annetta figured out the two most evil looking Northerners were not who they said they were was because two guards randomly were like \"oh yeah these two huge ass people with blue hair and a very unique cane were seen with this dead guy right before he died, wonder what happened there?\" Surely there could've been a better way to do that reveal. The the characters backstories are unique enough even if their romance is about as generic as you can get with the classic of one of the romantic interests hiding who they really are and the other is a dunce.\nThe art is certainly art. I mean it gets its point across, it's no Fist Demon of Mount Hua thankfully, but it's not like there were any panels where I was impressed in the slightest. I don't mean to be too rude but you could swap this out with just about any shojo manhwa's art and there would be no change. It also pains me that the shojo artstyle is always so stilted, the way these characters move have no fluidity to them, it feels like they all move as if they're robots. No I can't explain what this means, it just feels that way. Perhaps it's because generally the only panels involving an action are firstly the action being begun and then the next panel it's done, I don't know though. There's also a general lack of interesting camera angles, it's nearly always just headon with the only change being how cropped the person is. To me it made all the characters feel pretty flat and cardboard-y. Read a single recent chapter of Eleceed and then read a chapter of this and you'll probably get what I mean."

    "description": "This game went free on Epic Games recently so I thought I should finally try it out. It's certainly a good game and as someone who has watched and read an embarrassing amount of Harry Potter content, a giant game like was already guaranteed a passing grade of 5. I know this isn't the first time there has been a Harry Potter game but this certainly is the first time they had $150,000,000 to work with. Anyways as far as recreating the Harry Potter world they passed with flying colours. Obviously the world isn't quite the size that Rowling wrote because games like this take a shitload of money but for at least Hogwarts the school it feels even grander than in the books and movies. It's a great feeling playing a game like this and being able to walk through just about any door and inside finding a unique place which nearly always has something to see and read. It helps that the game looks so good and yet runs so well. To compare it to the other large 3D games I've been playing recently, this game looks a fair bit better than Elden Ring and E33 and yet runs a lot better than both. Maybe Elden Ring I can understand, it is a pretty massive game but frankly I should find it at least a little impressive how much better this game runs than E33. I have to assume that a good amount of work went into this game running so well and I applaud them for putting in that effort.\nContinuing my praises for a little while longer, they really made this magic school feel like one. The way books fly about in the library, armour stands move by themselves and instruments play themselves are all small details but went a long way in immersing me. I liked how, especially in the first few hours there felt like there were mysteries at every corner of this place. Like what's up with those mirrors? Oh, you use Lumos to see a clue of where to look. That's cool stuff that feels natural and makes the game feel less monotonous. Another part that immersed me was how good a lot of these characters were, smallchat, especially with my goat Natsai often got a chuckle out of me and also sounds exactly how I imagine magic teenagers to speak minus the cursing. The writing in this game was generally really good and so was the voice acting. To be honest near the start I was a little let down by my own character's voice acting but either the guy got better or I just got used to it because I ended up quite liking it. The writing in this game was very obviously British too and that is something I enjoy a lot more than American which is just about every game. I also really liked how good the game and general combat felt. I'd have liked if they upped the ante a little sometimes because even on the hardest difficultly I still felt like they could've pushed the system further. I'd also have liked some more non-human combat but it's whatever I guess. The music and sound design of this game is also really good, obviously it's nothing new for the Harry Potter series but the music sounds good as usual and the sounds are always satisfying to listen to. In my notes I wrote that it sounded \"Wizard101 pilled\", whatever that means.\nNow time to get into what I didn't like. The tutorial for this game is pretty bad, it's not popups galore like Elden Ring's tutorial but it's still not exactly great and it also lasts quite a long while which is a bit of a pain. This game can get slow at points and the gameplay loop of quests and pressing R 500 times to get EXP can quickly get old especially when you're like me and can never not find all the pages once you hear that little jingle. I'd have loved a more mage-esque way of earning EXP like you research spells or something. The quests were pretty underwhelming in general too, I know I complained about Elden Ring's quests being insane and impossible to follow but quests in this game are almost too easy to follow. This is a far more linear game than Elden Ring but even still I'd have liked if not all the quests had an exact quest marker and made me engage a little and put in some work. Arthur Plummly's treasure map quest (great voice by the way) was probably my favourite in the early game for that reason. It felt like I had to do a little work to figure out where to go and it was pretty cool. My only qualms are that the purple circle thing seems to show up before you are even close so it gives it away and my quest bugged and my guy decided he found the painting while being a floor beneath it which was a little bizarre. I quite liked the other quests that make you figure out which spell to use to solve whatever's going on (though it's usually pretty obvious). I found it a little strange how I was stealing so much shit in this game, like why could my guy just go around robbing chests for every coin they had. I'd had also quite liked it if there was a wider variety of spells. According to Google there are 30-34 spells and to be honest after having played Skyrim mods with more than that I'd liked to have seen more and to be honest some more gimmicky combat spells that only work in specific situations would've been fun and spiced up gameplay for me. Some healing spells could've been cool too because I don't love needing healing potions, especially when they need to be purchased or made. I guess it's not too terrible for a game as easy as this as it would be for a game like Elden Ring but it's still a bit of a pain. Lastly it was very weird that Natsai (despite being my goat), became my best friend only about an hour after meeting her. I don't know if this would've happened with Sebastian too but it was a little odd, maybe I just have bad social skills and this is how though quickly most people become good friends. I'm not entirely sure.\nEdit: Alright I started a new playthrough and I have a little more to say, firstly there is a fair bit of repeated dialogue so it'd be cool if they had either recorded more or just not play it after I heard it the first time as to be honest I'd rather hear nothing than \"there's such a thing as trying too hard\" over and over. I also think this game is trying to hard to keep me safe, let me jump off shit and break my legs please, let me jump across railings. It could've made exploration more interesting if my guy could do parkour. The jingle that plays when I find field guide pages is making me go a little insane and so is when they really should fully appear but they just decide not to so I have to cast revelio again. There were also a few cutscenes that just inexplicably didn't follow the volume settings I had chosen and instead bravely decided to just max it out for no reason. I skipped most cutscenes on the second time so I don't know how common it was. I'd also forgotten to mention how metal some of the ancient magic kills are, like I fully mashed a poacher into the dirt shit's crazy.\nEdit 2: I just read a fuckass Reddit post about how someone doesn't like the options for responding to dialogue but to be honest I thought they were really good and the \"mean\" options were always really funny even if it doesn't really matter what you select."

I love the diversity of powers and how generally unique the story is while still not getting too out of my comfort zone. Kind of a more depressing Eleceed if you can follow my logic. I also really like the MC and how she uses her powers in usually a very smart way even if some of the choices she makes do feel a little out of place and not thought out. The story can also go into a little too edgy territory for my taste sometimes but generally those moments are pretty few and far between. I would like if the author got to the point a little more as there seem to be a lot of strands at the moment and I'm still waiting to see how they connect. I can easily see this lasting 400-500 chapters but I'm pretty here for it to be honest. I do kind of wish some of the side characters get more time to be fleshed out too as a lot of focus is on just two or three characters when I feel like there are a lot of interesting people I'd like to see more of."

I don't mean to be rude but this guy really doesn't seem good at any aspect of writing aside from maybe the characters who are all quite distinct. I didn't find the story super engaging, it gave the appearance of being unique but the longer I read the more I came to realise how cliche a lot of this is and it only took about 20 chapters to realise what the issue I was sensing was. This dude is wayy too in manga (or anime whatever). It's so blindingly obvious and offputting, reading this was like reading Dog Nigga but at least the guy writing that one was very aware of what he was doing and it made for some funnier moments where he subverted the norm. Here that is unfortunately not the case. The best part of the story was the alternate history aspect but that aspect also pissed me off because why would you even bother adding all that if history progressed in almost the same way as in our world. Like wouldn't it have been crazy if Hitler won this time round or something? Instead once you get to the real story you're tragically awoken to the fact that it's just a hodgepodge of tropes from shonen manga I've already read. This guy even named the powers Kimyos and had fuckers saying nani like I know what you are...\nI really didn't mean to go so hard in this but this shit was really welling up in my chest I guess. I read this: https://webtoons.com/en/creators101/webtoon-canvas/creator-story/1 and the creator of this Webtoon does seem like a genuinely good guy who does actually care but I'd say he'd do a much better job being just an artist for something (I cannot give justice to how good the art for this is, especially compared to most comics)."

Was I reading this slowly because I'm illiterate? Probably in part but mainly it was because this book is so ass. I was fine with the original Percy Jackson book, I think it held up well enough for my nostalgia to bridge the gap for me and make it worth reading through but I only made it 45% through this book according to my reading app before calling it quits tonight and reading the rest in the supercut comic form.\nA big part of why I found this book so incredibly boring was just how small it felt in comparison to the first. Like sure Grover not dying and getting the fleece is important or whatever but these stakes really don't compare with word ending stakes. Also it's kind of annoying just how weak the half-blood's seem in this book, maybe I'm just blinded by shitty comic power-scaling but it feels like you could give just about any normal person a gun and they'd be easily able to kill off any half-blood. Like imagine how easily Luke could've won if instead of doing sword fight bullshit he just had a pistol like that one Indiana Jones scene. It doesn't help that Percy and his gang are forced to use gimmicks to win basically every fight, that is when they're not relying on Tyson of course who I really disliked. Like why do Percy and Annabeth really need this giant strong guy who got dropped on his head one to many times as a baby? The only thing I can think of is that Mr Riordan is trying to subliminally influence his young readers into not bullying autistic people or something. I know I sound insane but just think about it for a second, Percy disrespects Tyson for like the first half of the story and Annabeth is like racist or something but by the end of it they're both like this guy's not so bad (probably, I'm pretty sure the comic cut this whole character arc but I also might've just forgotten). Not so crazy after all. Anyways this book sucks so I probably won't read any more of this series. Nothing like relooking at something you're nostalgic about to cure nostalgia."

    "description": "Has Jane Remover dropped the best project twice in one year? No but she did get really close to it. While I'm not sure if an EP with six songs, four of which being your best songs from last year quite counts as a new release that doesn't change the fact that this shit bangs. The two new songs \"So What?\" and \"Music Baby\" are admittedly the worst on the project but with a lineup as stacked as this being the worst isn't something to be ashamed of.\nThis EP is most certainly a Jane Remover project in that every song has you slamming through 20 panes of glass, an element that I once foolishly believed would detract from a pop-adjacent album (or EP in this case) but after having so thoroughly enjoyed Revengeseekerz I've grown accustomed to Jane's unique style of production so it wasn't as much as a sensory overload as it may be to many first time listeners of Jane. I've read a couple reviews for this (from random people online, music publications fear Jane's power) and there does seem to be a sentiment that this was quite an exhausting experience which I can completely get, I felt like dying the first time I heard Revengeseekerz and it gave me a raging headache, however I'm fairly certain this wouldn't have been nearly as interesting if it had more \"normal\" production so I guess it's a bit of a double edged sword. These comments are pretty broad however as sonically each song is pretty distinct, for instance you won't feel like you're shooting through a greenhouse in the appropriately dreamy \"Dream Sequence\" which does an excellent job wrapping up this EP and making it feel much more like a coherent experience. I also want to mention how sick the whistles (I think) are on \"How To Teleport\". I almost want to say the song almost sounds Latin (perhaps Reggaeton) but I don't want to elaborate or I'm going to end up being horribly wrong and it's going to be super embarrassing.\nAs far as lyrics go I dunno, they aren't anything special for Jane and didn't leave me super impressed. I preferred how she went for Revengeseekerz but that could be partially because that was an actual album so it ended up having more cohesion but I really feel as if there is some lost potential here with the lyrics to make the project sound more like its own thing rather than a set of disconnected songs. Anyways I should start wrapping this up as I've almost spent as much time writing this as this project is long and it's 1:18AM so I wouldn't mind some sleep. Sorry if I compared this too much to Revengeseekerz especially when they aren't even vaguely in the same genre but it's not often I get a chance to compare two albums by the same person in the same year. The last time this happened was with Kanye dropping Vultures 1 and 2 and unfortunately I didn't give enough of a fuck about Vultures 2 to compare shit (or even write shit I wrote like two sentences lmao 😭)."

    "description": "Embarrassingly enough I really enjoyed La La Land which I certainly didn't expect after spending most of my life actively avoiding watching musicals. Ryan Gosling playing Sebastian and Emma Stone playing Mia may have gone a little too hard, Gosling especially was unexpectedly way better than I assumed he'd be in a musical. Apparently he even learnt how to play the piano with this which if true is pretty impressive and paid off imo as the scene of Sebastian putting his heart into his piece only for nobody to care except for Mia who knows exactly how he's feeling was easily one of the best of this film. This kind of feeds into how I found it very cool how the film is a constant mix between idealism (the musical segments) and realism (the non-musical segments) and the switch between the two is never all that jarring. Just to talk about the scene of Sebastian playing the piano again, the way the spotlight hit him as the played and got engrossed in his music felt very natural which is why it was all the more soul crushing when he steps up to find nobody actually gave a damn about what he just did. Like I deadass expected everyone to stand up and start clapping or something and I'm fairly sure many others did and that was completely subverted. In the end this idea of idealism vs realism climaxes, the pair's dreams get in the way of their relationship and instead of everything working out they have to choose one and give up on the other. Like that's just not something I see often and there aren't many films that can do an ending scene like La La Land's.\nAt first I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to take a film where the characters spontaneously broke into dance seriously however while that was partially the case I also think the fact that this film isn't some mega serious world changing story (obviously it is for the characters involved but I'm sure you hopefully get what I'm saying) helped with that so all instead of taking me out the musical numbers really just helped set the mood, even better than many traditional means movies may take because it's so in your face about how it wants you to feel. On top of that, I think the musical numbers served as a good way to have a visual and auditory way to see how the characters are thinking more than just expressions and words which was pretty cool. Can't say I wasn't a little disappointed that they used their best song for their first song but at least I was hooked instantly and it's not like the rest of the songs were duds, the majority of soundtrack was pretty packed with good songs, a look at their Spotify numbers would tell show that much. I also have to assume the amount out of their 30m budget they needed to blow renting out a busy road to film on was pretty significant so it'd be even worse if the song they had during that scene ruined it. I'd love to also know how people driving past this were thinking when they saw this insane shit going on during their daily commute. I also just gotta say, I'm not sure if I'm onto it but \"Another Day Of Sun\" was foreshadowing what would happen right?? Like the first girl left her boyfriend to be a star or whatever??\nI also really like the way this film is shot, not exactly an interesting opinion based on how this film was received online but it seems very few of my opinions are and this is my site so you're not allowed to stop me. Obviously the pretty iconic by this point scene of the male and female lead dancing over Los Angeles (I think) is where most people's minds go and it's no surprise, they used that scene for their excellent cover for a reason, but it felt like most scenes were brightly lit and everyone was wearing bright colours. Compared with many of the very grey films I usually these days (though by the looks of it the tide has been changing on that front in the recent years) watching La La Land was a lot more of a visually stimulating experience. This choice probably was to do with how theatrical this whole film is, maybe that's common for musicals but as I mentioned I'm not super into musicals so I wouldn't know.\nI didn't really know where to fit this stuff in so here are some pretty disjointed thoughts; my favourite part of this film however was how everyone was smiling in the dancing sections. Again I don't have the data to know whether that's just a musical thing but I like to imagine they were just having a good time. When Stone had a smirk during her and Gosling's dance in \"A Lovely Night\" I couldn't help crack up a little. The longer I write this for the more I realise I've just watched way too many action films and need to get out of my comfort zone a little more often but whatever can't stop won't stop. I didn't know J.K Simmons could smile so it was nice to see that near the end.\nEdit: 8.5 -> 10, yeah sorry I locked the fuck in a little. I've watched this film about four extra times since writing this and almost obsessively listened to the soundtrack too. Apparently the soundtrack is currently my 70th most listened to album and Another Day of Sun is my 7th most listened to song and they're both only rising. Every time I rewatch I feel like I notice some subtly in the acting I hadn't before or notice some smart line, it's fantastic. My only complaint is that you can't hear the sound of their shoes tapping in A Lovely Night on Spotify.\nEdit 2: The OST is now my 44th most listened to album."

    "description": "I can't lie, I did only watch this because Andy Sandberg was in it but I was happily surprised by how good the female lead played by Cristin Milioti was despite having never heard of her before. She was a cool character and her being the one taking the initiative and saving Sandberg's character after he had giving up was very sweet even if the science involved seemed dubious at best. Another part of this film I didn't expect was how good some of the, especially atmospheric music was. Like that scene about twenty minutes in where the female lead is laying against a rock did not need to go that hard. I also really just like the whole time loop premise and I think lots of the jokes are original enough despite how many of these there have been now. There was even a joke about how it was a \"classic time loop situation\" which I thought was really funny. J.K. Simmons was funny too, and I think he and Sandberg had better chemistry than Sandberg and the female lead. It's also pretty nice that since I haven't watched so many of these that people not giving a damn about other people dying horrifically is still entertaining to me.\nIf I'm being for real I don't really have anything super bad to say about this movie, it looked good, achieved its goal of being a feel good time pretty proficiently and even if it not being anything super unique or powerful means it won't stick with me at least it was fun while it lasted. It did start to derail in the second half however. I guess the CGI could've been better though because it looked good awful but whatever, I also wasn't in love with the more serious moments but I have to imagine it wouldn't even be an hour long without them. Like if Sandberg's character was truly stuck in a timeloop to the point he's forgotten almost everything about his life prior which I have to assume is at least 50 years that'd make him 90 or so and to be honest even if he's emotionally stunted due to being in a timeloop I doubt any 90 year old, or even 30 year old would act like this. The scene near the end where Sandberg's character rushes to go to Milioti's at the last minute however was super cliche, at least they weren't in an airport but still. It was almost to the point I thought it might've been a parody but I have to assume if that was the case it'd have been more funny."

You can really tell this is around the point where they started running out of ideas for romcoms because this is a pretty batshit premise but it's cute and often pretty funny too which is quite the accomplishment for any romcom. There weren't any laugh out loud moments here but there were a good few loud exhales and it was able to keep my attention for an hour thirty. What more does a person need? I will say there were some more darker moments that I wasn't sure if were done that way on purpose or not.

Firstly the MC is super unlikeable, one of the most of anything I've ever read to be honest, it got to a point that I just had to stop reading because I wanted to throttle this dickhead, he's so often an asshole just to be one, maybe I'd understand if he was doing it because it was going to benefit him later down the line or something but even when it has no benefit to him at all and the only effect is negative he's still the worst just for the love of the game. If he was going to go through some character development and better himself that'd be pretty interesting and maybe he still will but it's going far too slowly at that rate and once I found out the author of this Manhwa also authored Nano Machine and Absolute Sword Sense I knew I had to get out of here. He can't even develop martial arts-wise either because he is so naturally gifted that he never struggles. It makes me wonder what's even the point of a story with a character who never struggles?? Even Mr Solo Leveling struggled at the start and that manhwa is basically the poster child for OP MCs.\nThis thing also just has way too much edge for my liking. Maybe that'd be interesting if this was released a few years ago but at this point there are mountains of mangas, manhwas and manhuas to read with just as fucked up scenarios and MCs. This isn't even the first time this author has done a story like this as he's already made Nano Machine so this is just a repeat with worse art and an even more unlikeable MC because this time he's autistic or something and can't even comprehend the idea of getting along with people. I also can't help but find it a little weird how badly this author wants to put unwilling men in the bodies of women, you can already tell he's a freak after Nano Machine so I can only imagine where he's thinking about going with this."

The rest of this manga is generally pretty tough to sit through, I'm aware drama is necessary to make something not a boring ass slice of life but it's for sure gone way too all in on the depressing factor and the rest of the manga is suffering for it. A girl dying is one thing, Your Lie In April did that premise quite spectacularly, however on top of that they also throw on that this girl got kidnapped because her stepmom and sister hate her, but then on top of that she's running away with a batshit insane assassin and they keep doing this about four more times, piling more and more depressing shit on until it's so uncomfortable to read through. Like this girl's life is miserable and even the moments of hope don't do all that much for me because like I'm not exactly rooting for you to fall in love with this heinous assassin guy so when I'm watching basically stockholm syndrome setting in it's not exactly a triumphant moment.\nAside from the whole idea of this manga seemingly like a bad idea to me I also don't really love the characters. Maybe the author is under some big time crunch but the character development felt really weird in this and just the way the characters acted in general. It really felt like it should've taken the bodyguard more time to join the side of the assassin (sorry I'm awful with names), like it felt as if only a few chapters had passed before suddenly they're going from wanting to actually murder each other to just arguing. Same with the MC and the assassin, any time they had any kind of dispute it was solved in less than a volume even if it's something batshit that I can't imagine anyone getting over so easily.\nDespite all my complaining however I was still bizarrely engaged the whole way through 75 chapters (the amount of chapters released as of writing this) which usually isn't the case for anything I have as many problems with as I do this and strangely I'm pretty sure I'll be checking out at least the next few chapters especially because it looks to be starting to wrap up. For this reason I'm going to give it a begrudging five as I must've liked it at least somewhat to have somehow been caught hook line and sinker by it."

Fortunately I stuck around because in general the acting was pretty good here especially considering I don't really know any of these people (not that I keep up to date with many celebrities) and their chemistry was really good, there were several moments that got a chuckle out of me which lightened the often oppressive mood. This show was mainly carried for me by the really good premise but I felt like this was in general better than a one of the mill teen drama you might expect though I have to wonder how realistic this is to an American highschool because this fuckin place is lawless.\nThe main issues I had with this show was firstly the length of episodes, because holy shit they did not have enough stuff to fill 50 minute episodes. This isn't exactly unique to this show but it still hurt it, to be honest I think the show could've been done in a single movie instead of two seasons and that decreased runtime would probably be to its benefit. To be fair it didn't super feel like it was dragging by the end of season one but by season two I started feeling it. As well as this I way too mad at these fictional characters because the writers for some reason made them all idiots, or at least it felt like it, even the ones who are meant to be smart. I'm trying to leave spoilers out my comments but you just gotta know that these kids don't have an inkling of common sense amongst them. Simon was pretty funny at least... I wonder what happened to that guy. My last issue is with how this show was filmed because I get the purpose of different camera angles but some scenes felt like the director was doing a checklist to fit as many camera angles into the scene as physically possible, sometimes it's okay to not tilt the camera. Slight spoiler warning but this show also manages to end on a cliffhanger which sucks but it's not exactly their fault they got cancelled."

There also just happened to be a lot of shit in this show I couldn't care less about. I was practically asleep during Daenerys' parts in the first like five seasons. It just felt hard to care about what was going on when they were so far from the main cast of characters despite being nearly certain that eventually there would be a climax to this storyline when she eventually takes back the kingdom. Same thing for whatever the fuck was going on with Bran but worse because I didn't have a clue where it was going.\nMy favourite character by far was Arya Stark, she was just out here on some real shit the entire time, her dynamic with Syrio Forel, The Hound and especially Tywin Lannister were so fucking good, the scene where Littlefinger goes to talk to Tywin while Arya is in the room was so tense in a good way and was really up there for me with that scene between Hans and Shosanna in Inglourious Basterds. This show was overflowing with good characters like that but it only really felt like it utilized a few, and somehow out of that small handful three of them were Lannisters 😭.\nAnother aspect I quite liked about Game of Thrones was the world, it's one of the few fictional worlds I've seen that was just really convincing, they made it very easy to believe that such a world could easily exist and wherever they shot was a great choice. The world did feel a teensy bit small but what can you really do, it's a TV show after all. It's a little silly that this is all I can think to say at the moment for this long ass show but yeah it's pretty good, not great but pretty good, did kind of leave me feeling bittersweet though as it felt like it had so much unused potential, maybe I'll watch House of Dragons to see if that's an improvement."

The bosses are also a bit of a letdown as most of them are simple to a fault and reach a point of tedium for me especially the earlier one but they never really improve to that point that I enjoy them as much as some of my favourite rogue-likes like Enter The Gungeon and considering how small the actual pool of bosses in this game are it's even harder to forgive. Like I cannot understand how you make only seven bosses (I think don't quote me on that though) and one of them is Hydra. Like wtf were they thinking with that boss?? At least the titular Hades is a pretty cool fight if just for spectacle alone. The boons and levels of this game were pretty good though especially as far as rogue-likes go. I had especially enjoyed how some of the duo synergy things between boons when gods fucked with each other but I also think it could've been cool to have negative synergies for gods that didn't like each other as much which would have to make you think a little more but I dunno that's just off the dome.\nThe best part of this game is handily the music, I'm not sure this game has a single bad song and I find myself listening to some of them even when not playing the game, especially No Escape it's just so good. Up there with DS3 in quality of main menu themes. Mr Darren Korb did a great job. The voice acting on the other hand, I dunno. Part of it definitely has to do with the script which kind of makes me cringe but I've heard worse and I'm a sucker for Greek Mythology too but the voice acting itself was really where it all fell apart for me. The guy playing Zagreus did pretty alright, some of his lines sounded a little lifeless and unnatural but its fine however even his performance was one of the best. I'd like to single out whoever played Aphrodite however because holy shit she did a terrible job. She is so fucking close to the microphone that I swear to god I can hear that ASMR lip smack sound every time she speaks. I don't know if maybe I've just finally lost it because when I Googled about it nothing really came up but any time she spoke she immediately broke any immersion I had as I immediately became acutely aware this was not in fact a god it was just a woman in a recording booth (or more likely just a phone considering how bad it sounds). If she had moved maybe just a few inches away from the microphone when you spoke I doubt it'd have been nearly as bad. I know I've kind of slammed the game for the entire second half of this but I really didn't think it was all that bad and if you don't give a damn about story and will be skipping dialogue anyway it's well worth your time."

I liked how this film had the gang going to lots more places and actually seeing the galaxy, giant worms and all as I feel that's the most compelling aspect of Star Wars. A snowy planet is always cooler than a desert one and temperature being an actual concern even just at the start was pretty cool too. Some of the CGI and greenscreening was fucked up so it was lucky Yoda was just a silly puppet guy, lowkey fit his character too. The Darth Vader father reveal is probably the most iconic moment in Star wars and the force actually being a thing in this movie was cool too. The relationship between Leia and Han Solo was a little wack though as George Lucas clearly didn't really put much thought into romance in these movies so it does make me wonder why he added it at all."

The film itself was technically impressive with a story that seems so large even now however the actual execution of this was just a shit imho. Mark Hamill especially really doesn't do it for me as an actor in this and even the actors I like more like Carrie Fisher as Leia have dialogue that doesn't feel all too realistic to me. C3PO is also just super fuckin annoying and there was too many scenes of characters speaking these made up languages, I'd rather be unimmersed than have to sit through all this. The sets are generally very well done however I do gotta say that Tatooine really doesn't feel like another planet some of the time especially when you can see mountains in the distance, I dunno.

It has been about a week since this album dropped as I'm writing this and while I can't say it's as good as 3D Country it's very close, still great, and I think as more time passes it may grow on me further. To be honest I was a bit worried when I first heard Trinidad, it sounded pretty frantic and I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy an album like that nor was I certain such a dramatic change would've been something Geese could pull off. I mean the song was definitely trying to sound frantic and insane and they pulled that off at least, a highlight being the mixing when Cameron Winter is yelling THERE'S A BOMB IN MY CAR as it goes from ear to ear trying to give me a stroke, I just wouldn't like to listen to an entire album like this, I might go insane. Luckily it was more of an outlier if anything and followed up by one of the best songs on this album, Cobra. I love this song so much I can't even lie, it's so groovy and welcoming especially after Trinidad, like a warm shower or something while still sounding different enough from other Geese music to make me feel like they aren't stagnating. I really like the voice Cameron Winter is singing with when he has baby at the start of the song, makes me smile every time. If I'm being real, while Trinidad was fine I'd have much preferred for it to be thrown out and for Cobra to be the first song on this album as it felt much less out of place alongside the rest of this project.\nI don't know shit about music so the next thing I'm about to say may sound a little deranged but you might just have to hear me out, I love how deep the drums sound in many songs on this album, namely Husbands and Taxes. It sounds like they're being played deep in a pit or something and that kind of sound both isn't something I hear much at all, in fact I'm drawing blanks trying to think of any other times I've heard a similar style. It really contributes to an almost down to earth feeling (bdum tss) I get when listening to this album even if lyrically it's just as wacky as any other Geese or Cameron Winter project.\nOne last bit because I'm very addicted to Sekiro right now and want to get back to it but the last two songs are some of the greatest songs Geese or to be honest anyone has ever made and really elevate this project. It's a really great way to send off such an album and I've surely listened to both songs upwards of 50 times already because of just how catchy they are. I've been humming Taxes ever since it came out and it's annoying everyone close to me, I just can't help it when the \"DOCTOR! DOCTOR! Heal yourself~~\" part is so good at getting rooted deep into my skull.\nEdit: 8 -> 8.5, chat, it grew on me. Watch out Long Island City, here I come."

    "description": "Dark Souls 3, my lovely boy. I've been meaning to write my thoughts on this game down at some point but I just hadn't gotten around to it until now and in the meantime I've beaten the game three extra times so my thoughts should be a little more coherent.\nFirst off let me talk about this game's bosses because that's what most people think about when they think about Dark Souls. It has a better boss lineup that 1, 2 and Elden Ring. I haven't played Bloodborne or Demon Souls but by the looks of some clips it beats those two as well. Now while this is high praise I should point out I personally don't think FromSoftware is all that good at making bosses, there are about 11 great bosses in this game out of the 25 bosses total. This alone isn't a terrible ratio but there are also just a whole bunch of bosses that are straight ass, most people complain about Curse-Rotted Greatwood and and High Lord Wolnir but I want to complain about the Abyss Watchers here. These guys do not get enough hate, the first phase is the boss basically playing itself and the second phase is so comically easy that it's barely even a fight. Genuinely how do people like these guys?? Thankfully all the bad bosses in this game are easy to an almost comical degree but this is mainly because all the bosses in the game are pretty easy (though being easy doesn't mean a boss is instantly terrible contrary to popular belief, my personal sweet spot is somewhere between this difficulty and Sekiro's difficulty). People really love to overhype this game's difficultly, maybe it's to gatekeep or something, maybe I just can't comprehend their great minds but I only really struggled with Nameless King and even then I beat that guy in like an hour which is shorter than it took me to beat Lady Butterfly in Sekiro. One last thing about the difficulty, I was straight terrified going into the Pontiff's arena because I had heard so many horror stories about how hard he is and then I beat him first try. It was frankly fucked up, maybe I'm just the goat what can I say (it's 100% because I had accidentally overleveled).\nThe real sell of this game for me was the exploration, it's by far my favourite in this game, more so than any other FromSoftware games I've played. There's just so much shit to find and explore and with so much enemy and item variety it made exploring super fun and rewarding not to mention the game is really good at subtly funnelling you to where you need to go (except for getting to Archdragon Peak because what the fuck). I know this isn't particularly unique to this game but struck the perfect balance for me with the game's scale. I also really just think the world holds up well, my favourite parts are the more gothic, somewhat Bloodborne-esque areas but I just about enjoyed everything except maybe the fuckass poison swamps. Due to exploration being so enjoyable for me I did feel a little overleveled for many bosses however because after exploring so much I kind of naturally just became strong as shit.\nI should probably throw out some miscellaneous complaints as I did with other FromSoftware games. Firstly, as is tradition for FromSoftware apparently, I didn't get Playstation glyphs when I plugged my controller in, only XBOX. It was annoying but expected at this point. What wasn't expected was that my controller straight up wouldn't fucking work until I used a tool to make it act like an XBOX controller which was a pain in the ass. I'm pretty sure Steam is meant to do that but it just didn't work this time round and also it really shouldn't need to fall on Steam's shoulders to do FromSoftware's jobs for them. I also hated how you couldn't pause the game, I have to assume it's something to do with the online functionality but as someone who played offline because I went insane reading the bullshit people wrote on the ground everywhere online functionality doesn't matter to me and I'd much rather they figured out how to make the game pause instead. Like sometimes shit just comes up when I'm in a dangerous area so I just gotta either die because quitting out takes too long. Anyways despite me being a big meany I really do love DS3 which is why generally I'm so harsh on the rest of the FromSoftware games because I know how much higher they can reach."

Why did this guy specify that? In fact it would've made more sense for him to just say it's like a riot. The only thing I could think of is that maybe Finn watched a sports riot video which would've made it make sense to know about one and also for the reference to be so clunky but nah I think they just fucked up. The jokes also just get worse as this goes on, maybe the writer forgot how to write funny things as time went on, I really don't know. It was a real shame though.

    "description": "I've put off giving Silksong a proper write-up despite it being my favourite game to be released this year and probably top two of all time, switching its position depending on the day, but that transgression is being taken back today. In the art and gameplay department, I think Silksong is a straight improvement from Hollow Knight. I've seen some people complaining about how the brighter colours make Silksong less atmospheric than Hollow Knight and I can certainly see why people are upset by that, but personally I don't think it's even a fair comparison. They both fit their respective games pretty well. Hallownest was an already dead kingdom, so greys and blues made a lot of sense, but Pharloom isn't dead just yet, and as it gets closer to its demise in Act Three you can even see the vibrancy being sucked out of the kingdom, which is a super cool touch. On top of this, Ari Gibson popped off detail-wise in this game, not to say he didn't in Hollow Knight but it feels like every hall in the Citadel that I sprint down has an intricately drawn background that almost nobody will ever even see properly.\nSilksong took another step up from Hollow Knight in the insane fluidity of its movement, replaying Hollow Knight feels painful (a little hyperbolic) now. Playing as Ghost which I always thought played really great, is near incomparable in enjoyment when up against playing as Hornet. Running around as her makes me feel like some sort of Olympic gymnast and it's very freeing. This is obviously helped by the wonderful unique animations for each crest but also the gameplay additions, like Hornet's ability to sprint and then chain that into an attack and then perhaps even chain that into a Clawline, charged attack, silk skill, or red tool. Hornet has so many options when getting into a fight that it never felt dull to me to same enemy for the hundredth time as I run down a corridor. I never felt the urge to avoid a fight to save time like I have in other games. Many enemies in Silksong seem to also have more complex attack patterns than in Hollow Knight (not really in the first couple of areas, but things really ramp up when you get to the ants) and fighting these little critters, exploring new areas and finding new upgrades was a gameplay loop that never got old. The new healing in the air and three masks at a time is great too and opened up Silksong for more ferocious boss fights with more unique arenas like Nyleth's. It can even be used to dodge some attacks when you need to stay above the ground, and I felt like a genius when I used that to narrowly dodge an attack from Widow I didn't think I could dodge otherwise (I hadn't realised you could pogo off the bells). I even liked some more controversial changes like the removal of iframe dashes and a general decrease in iframes after being hit. It forced me to fight in a more interesting way than just dashing through enemies or spamming descending dark. I did have one singular issue with the movement in this game: the way double jump and hover fight each other for priority. Like, sometimes I just want to hover, but it won't let me. I feel like they could've set hover to activate when X is held and double jump to activate when it's just pressed, but that's just me I guess. I suppose you get used to it after a point but I'd rather it just didn't exist.\nCrests are also a really cool system, even if I stuck with mainly Hunter and then Witch once I got it. I just like being able to have the option to play the game in a different way, even if there are crests like Reaper and Beast, which actively make it harder. I also quite liked the tools system, more than charms at least. I never felt like I just needed to fill a slot like I did with charms and ended up putting in random bullshit to fill a spare charm slot. The fact that tools are separated by their general purpose helps too, even if some of the grouping choices felt bizarre to me. Like why is magnetite dice not a blue tool? It feels like the only exclusively combat-buffing yellow tool, not that I'm complaining because the best tool in the game being basically free to include in any build is pretty rad. I will complain for a minute about my main issue with this game, however, which is how red tools were handled. I don't know if Team Cherry were coked up like crazy or what when they decided to add shards because their addition seems to be only to slow down the game (or maybe to balance the Architect Crest, not that it worked). I never really used tools (aside from in boss battles that I knew I could win because I was worried about wasting my pretty limited amount of shell shards even when their capacity was maxed out). On top of that Bone Bottom had a few quests that required me to give up 400 or so shell shards, which made me assume I'd need to conserve them in case of more quests like that, but nope. I might be misremembering, but I'm pretty sure those were the only times shell shards were used in this way. I wish they just made the red tools recharge at benches for free because then I'd have freedom to experiment and try out different red tool-based builds, but shards aren't a deal-breaker, just a pain in the ass. Needing to go to specific places to recharge Plasmium and Flea Brew was a real pain too and just led to me never using Flea Brew; it just felt so unnecessary.\nTo continue my hating, I'm going to talk a little about bosses. I was disappointed by many of these guys, but not for the reason you think (or maybe it is the reason you think, I wouldn't want to assume). Lots of people had issues with the difficulty of Silksong, but personally, I never had any issue with it. Silksong is the sequel to Hollow Knight so I don't think it's all that far-fetched for Team Cherry to have expected the players to beat Hollow Knight before playing it and built the difficulty around that expectation. I'd have actually been upset if the game was any easier to be honest, because if I didn't struggle with bosses like the Last Judge or Lost Lace it'd have lost that satisfying feeling I get from games like this. My actual issue with this game's bosses was that they didn't feel like they were pushing far enough. Like I mentioned, this game was a sequel to Hollow Knight, so why didn't Team Cherry take this chance to make super inventive and different bosses than were in Hollow Knight? This isn't to say there weren't any unique bosses, Silksong had Father of Flame, Fourth Chorus, Voltvyrm, Bell Eater and Nyleth just off the top of my head, but there were also a fair few that felt really reminiscent of Hollow Knight's bosses. I mean when I first fought Moss Mother, I was like, \"Oh, this is a green Vengefly King.\" When I fought Bell Eater, I was like, \"Oh, this is Massive Moss charger but with bells\". When I first fought Lace, I was like, \"Oh this is Hornet\". Those were the first three bosses (or you could've fought Skull Tyrant who was Brooding Mawlek), that's not the impression you want to send. Not to say these were bad fight, hell, all of them were better than their Hollow Knight counterparts,  but I'd personally have liked if they went a little wacky with it, even if it ended up being the worst thing ever. Lace did fortunately split off from the other two, however, and her second and third battles were some of the best in any game I've ever played and fairly distinct from Hornet's fights, so it wasn't a full loss, but I'll talk a little more about the follow-up Laces in a minute. Before I talk about the best bosses however, I'd like to talk about the worst. There were a couple in this game (Palestag and Plasmified Zango) that I'm not sure are even bosses, and Plasmified Zango didn't even give me anything for beating him. It was all very confusing. Gurr the Outcast was also in a similar situation. He was a little more of a boss, but he had like a single move, gave you a huge window to attack, and all the fun was actually tracking him down and the surprise of being dropped into his arena. It was the same with Skull Tyrant, who didn't really have any redeeming qualities at all except for that surprise when he jumps you in Bone Bottom. Aside from those guys who didn't even feel like Team Cherry tried with, there were a few who did feel like attempts at being real bosses that just fell short, these include Phantom, Shakra (tragically), First Sinner, Pinstress and Seth. I'll explain my reasoning on Phantom, First Sinner and Seth because I don't think anyone's going to fight me over saying Shakra or Pinstress aren't all that fun (though you can just replace every time I say Seth with Shakra because he's basically just a reskin of her).\nI like just about everything about Phantom apart from her fight; the Exhaust Organ is great, her lore is too and \"She spun us to fade... She spun us to break...\" are some of the hardest lines in this game. Her music is so good I've been listening to it in the background while just doing other things, the organ sounds so fire in it, and the way she can be fought instead of the Last Judge as an alternative way to get into Act 2 is super cool, even if I didn't do that on my first playthrough. My issues with her come down to her fight, of which I have two main issues that ruin the whole thing for me. Firstly, her parry is an unsatisfying piece of shit attack even when you properly counter it, I don't like the sound she makes or the way she moves at all. My other problem is the way the steam starts really bellowing out in the second phase, which makes following her movements a real challenge for me, and I don't really care that other people don't have this issue. Buy me new eyes and we can see how the situation changes. Next is the First Sinner, who I'm sure I'll get the most shit about not liking out of any boss here because for some reason I can't comprehend why people think this is an all-time great boss. I can promise you this isn't a skill issue either, I beat Lost Sinner. I'm a pro gamer I promise. In fact, part of my issue is that she might be too easy; on my first playthrough, she died on my second try in under a minute. I didn't even need to heal. The crux of my issue with her, however, was that the only real way to fight her constantly teleporting away is spamming the Clawline or sprinting into her or both, and while I like sprinting and love the Clawline, it never felt all that fun on this boss, more like she was constantly running away and I was catching up to her and getting a single hit in before doing it again. Her attacks were so easy to dodge too because it felt like they almost never hit in the right spot to punish me for running over and hitting her. I'd have liked to say that her soundtrack made up for this because I love her boss music, but she shares it with a much better boss, Widow, much earlier into the game. I get that it's because they're both weavers, so it makes sense, but when I got to Last Sinner I wasn't thinking, \"wow, these guys must have the same boss music because they're related!!\" I was thinking, \"wow, they reused Widow's boss music\". The one positive I can say about Last Sinner is that breaking her heal is extremely satisfying. For Seth, no, I don't \"hate dead kids\" as a lovely comment put it, I just think that fighting Seth is a real pain in the ass, as he teleports around even more than First Sinner and unless you're using the Architect or the Wanderer crest, which both make short work of this guy, you're going to spend more time chasing this bastard than actually damaging him. He's also using Nyleth's theme, and you fight him literally right before Nyleth; it's so odd. He barely feels like he fits there and was just put in last minute, and this fucker also ruined my high scores on the Flea Games (except for juggle because I'm the goat), and for that, he cannot be forgiven.\nAlright, now onto talking about a few bosses I loved, and holy fuck, I'm just now realising how long this is going to end up being. I still haven't even said anything about the way areas were done, nor talked about the story, but I digress. Silksong has a shit ton of really fun bosses, even if many aren't super unique. I had an especially great time with all the Laces, Widow, Last Judge, Savage Beastfly 2 (I'll explain myself later, I promise), Cogwork Dancers (Clover Dancers too), Grandmother Silk, both Trobbios (gay Grimm), and Nyleth. To avoid making this apparently already 10-minute-long write-up even longer, I'll avoid talking about them too much and just talk about Savage Beastfly 2 and Nyleth because I've had death wished upon me for liking them before, so I think I'll need to do some explanation. I'll also talk about Lost Lace because she's the best boss I've ever fought, and I still get the tingling feeling I had when I beat her for the first time when I think about her even months after the fact. Savage Beastfly 2 is peak, and I'm tired of hearing him being slandered. He's a great positioning challenge, and it's so fun dodging his summon's lingering attacks while simultaneously avoiding falling into the lava and getting hit by him. It's a real testament to the gameplay of this fight that I can love a boss without meaningful lore, an interesting unlock or a memorable soundtrack this much, but even as I write this, I'm practically drooling at the thought of fighting this fucker again. Less controversially but still far from universally loved is Nyleth. I've seen just about as many people love her floor-dropping-out gimmick as I've seen absolutely despise it, but personally I think that and her beautiful OST that was stolen by Seth and I unfairly called boring the last time I talked about Silksong on here make Nyleth one of the most interesting bosses in Silksong. I love the panic that sets in when you see that yellow AOE attack and have to use Clawline to barely get out of the way in time; it's an orgasmic feeling, the same as when you manage to hit those spiked balls out of the air back at Nyleth despite it never being worth it. I just do it for the love of the game. Lastly, Lost Lace, the goat of Silksong. I've seen one too many people complain about the final boss of this game being a third Lace, but I simply cannot get behind that when Lace is so great, especially once you get to the second fight with her. The first fight, you could kind of wing it because she was so slow, but being forced to read the position of her needle and properly counter her parry, which goes from a dangerous attack to the best way to get in damage after you realise you always just have to jump and dodge towards her is super satisfying. Lost Lace just ups the ante, though; she's absolutely brutal and took me almost two hours to beat, and yet now I can beat her back to back without breaking a sweat. If that's not the mark of a good boss, I don't know what is. Her being a good boss isn't even the best part of the boss fight, though; it's the beautiful ass atmosphere. It has by far the best boss soundtrack in this game and probably any game; it's so grand and atmospheric and just the whole build-up to that moment just makes it feel so epic (I feel so silly saying epic but that's really the only word to describe it).\nAnother improvement I think Silksong makes upon Hollow Knight's formula is the narrative. Hornet is so much more of a character than Ghost, and being able to see her actually interacting with the other characters instead of just being talked at makes me like the other characters and her more. I cannot overstate how much Hornet being able to talk improved this game. I also love how the journal is written by Hornet this time around; it's so cool finding out she loves fluffy creatures or how she's fly racist (understandable considering what they put her through). The characters are just more interesting to me in this game. I liked Quirrel and all, but Garmond > Myla, and Flick clears everyone. I almost cried when he gave me that little statue, and the description had \"inexpertly but painstakingly crafted\", it was so sweet. I loved how Hornet and Shakra were proper friends, how Hornet (and everyone) wanted Kratt dead and how Sherma was just an innocent little guy running about. There were moments in this game, like Shakra's master's funeral, that just wouldn't have worked in a game like Hollow Knight but work here to great effect. The same situation applies to the Red Memory (though more so because Ghost never really did shit; what memories does he have?). I will say, the Nailsmith has way more swag than the Pinmaster. Also, fuck the Green Prince. I got you out of prison, man. I'll go into your mind whenever I want. I didn't even need his heart, but I don't regret killing him. Silksong also added a proper quest menu to track what you're doing and to give you a goal other than just wandering randomly, which I think is a good thing, but what I don't think was a good idea was these stupid fetch quests, which seem like a leap back game design-wise. Like, I'm sorry, but I don't want to collect bells, nor do I want to collect robes from dead guys, nor do I want to kill a bunch of birds (that was the worst one; it took me like ten minutes). I know I talked about how good the movement and combat was and that I didn't mind fighting the same guys over and over but that was when I was running about, being stuck in the same area, loading and reloading rooms to respawn enemies just to kill is such a boring waste of my time. I'm fine with going places and talking to people, but once I start needing to farm things, I think we have a problem. It's not like I could've just skipped doing this either though because I was worried I'd have missed the true ending which remains nearly as convoluted to get to as it did in the original Hollow Knight. The story itself is pretty alright, though saving a kingdom from a powerful being controlling the minds of the citizens isn't exactly breaking new ground for Hollow Knight.\nOne last thing I want to write about (I promise): the areas. This game has so many secrets; it feels like every second wall I hit has some cool stuff for me inside (or a frayed rosary bead). Hollow Knight had them for sure, but Silksong made it so every area was a secret room inside of three different secret rooms. Silksong also felt like it had a lot more variety in areas, and I loved how each place almost always had its own gimmick. I don't know if there was a single bad area in this game, not even Putrified Ducts because I liked the parkour you had to do by getting caught by the ceiling plant guys, maybe the Abyss, but you aren't there for long, and the parkour escape sequence from there is a great section. My favourites were probably The Citadel (which is so big it feels like its own game), Mount Fay and the Far Fields, which really gets into its stride in Act Three. I've heard some complaints about an overuse of gauntlets, but I didn't really feel that. To me the only hard ones were really the Choral Tower gauntlet and the High Halls gauntlet, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed, so it seems to me these people had more of an issue with the combat of Silksong than the gauntlets themselves.\nTLDR: It's like Hollow Knight if it was bigger and better.\nThanks for reading; make sure to smash the dislike button. I'll be sure to update this once the DLC releases, I hope the final boss of it will be a third Savage Beastfly."

Laufey's voice is great and makes for a really soothing album experience, the instrumentals are generally pretty great too. It does drag a little at some points, especially the middle as the songs are often pretty indistinguishable from one another and it kind of sent me into a trance like state but not in a good way because I basically tuned it out and had to go back and relisten to about four songs, however that streak ends with Tough Luck. Tough Luck was probably my favourite song on the album, it was catchy, unique (compared with the songs up to that point) and felt like a nice departure from the formulaic-ness of many songs up to that point. The lyrical content of this album was pretty impressive too, maybe my expectations for pop are too low but lyrics having any larger purpose than simply filling gaps is an impressive feat imho."

    "description": "On a whim I decided to start rereading this series as when I was but a boy I had really fond memories of it. This is probably the only book series I've ever read to completion, certainly the only one of this length. However it's been around half a decade since I last read one of these so there was a lot I forgot. First off I kind of remember Percy being like 15 or something so it was a bit of a surprise when they introduced him as a 12 year old. I guess that was probably one of the reasons I had got so into this at that age because as a schizo 12 year old I felt a really connection with Mr Jackson. Perhaps I thought I'd mysteriously get super powers like him one day too, but alas that day hasn't come just yet (still holding out hope though).\nI really hate how at the start of the book it's Percy talking to the audience. I mean I hate it in every book but here especially it comes off as so lazy because I don't even know what it's implying. Are they trying to say Percy was the one who wrote this book?? What I did like was not having to read every passage 20 times in order to understand it. A little semi-related rant but I'm so tired of books people say are good having been written 10000 years ago or being written like they were. A Tale of Two Cities is an awful book and I'm tired of pretending it's not. The flow in that shit is dead awful and I'm sure if I was a little more literate this would be less of an issue but I'm not so reading things made for actual 12 year olds is a nice change of pace sometimes. Another thing about the start, I feel like it would be really funny if there were a few chapters of Percy going insane. I don't know if anyone feels the same but I really enjoyed the small mystery elements in the beginning of this book and I'd have much preferred one big aha moment than three or four smaller ones.\nAnother problem I have with this book is, especially at the start, Percy asks questions or says something and half the time the person they're talking to just doesn't respond. Like fuck off dude, if I was in Percy's position I'd be so pissed off with these guys and it really isn't how normal people talk so it kind of took from how believable I found this. It might have been fine if it was only a couple times but it was at least 10 in the first 100 or so pages or so alone. Shiffs fluffed up.\nSome last smaller gripes for this gripe-filled review, I thought it was kind of insane how easily these kids kept being trapped. Like it was believable for Medusa to get them but everyone else past that point was comically avoidable and they were not nearly sceptical enough. Drove me mad. Another thing that drove me mad was how Percy didn't instantly get the actual meaning of his prophecy instantly. The kid's an idiot. This might also be a dumb question just what would happen if he just sat at camp if he was prophesied to finish the quest anyway? Would the lightning just teleport to him or something?\nAs for the positives, I don't have many but I was impressed that I was able to sit through this so it wasn't too much of a trainwreck I guess. Admittedly I'm not reading as much as I'd like these days, especially not proper picture-less books. Manga and Manhwa are fine and all but they don't really do anything for expanding my imagination or vocabulary. Even a book made for preteens had a better range of vocab than the average manga translation which was a little depressing... It was also a nice change in setting to a lot I read and watch, I don't see enough of the Greek gods despite them being so influential culturally (or more accurately the Greeks/Romans were but same thing).\nSidenote: Sorry if this review is insane and disjointed, I wrote it over like a month because I just couldn't be arsed, sorry."

I appreciate that Ayesha is at least trying something new production wise but this mixing is genuinely nightmarishly awful, like I cannot even comprehend how this happened. Also I get that having super sexual lyrics and all is basically her entire brand but after a decade of this it does get tiring and the songs don't bang nearly enough to cancel this out like was the case on some of her older songs. I know this might be a bit of an insane thing to say considering my favourite album of all time is The New Sound which I've seen countless people disregard because of the lyrical content but there I felt like it served a purpose and Greep was almost creative to a point of detriment. On here however it just feels like Ayesha is painfully unimaginative and hasn't had a new idea in years which kind of sucks. Listening to Emo Boy eight times would be vastly superior to listening to this album. That's about it, I'll leave you with a snippet of a review from AOTY I found funny though: \"the production is fairly challenging but in the same way it is challenging to paint while having no hands and being blindfolded\" - edgyrras."

Dunno how they managed to get that cleared but they're so real for it. They also some nice variety in their songs this time round with some being dead beautiful like IS THIS LOVE and DISCO TOMORROW (I love DISCO TOMORROW so much, one of their best) all while still having bangers like BUST DOWN in which Brae employs his profound intellect to think up lyrics like \"I'm half amazing and half Asian, I'm so good, you could say I'm Am-Asian\". They also have the line \"So much swag, call me a swaggot\" which may be one of the only times I've actually laughed at a lyric and it was intended. These guys are just so funny dude. Peggy song is quite the banger too and had been a track I kept coming back to ever since it was released as a single, JVB's features always seem to go crazy. Aside from that I don't really have much to say aside from gushing about this album more than I already have, just a big step up in every department for the pair and I can't wait to see where they go with this.

I literally counting the days for this release after having such a lukewarm 2025 music-wise so far and after having loved Quadeca's last LP \"I Didn't Mean To Haunt You\" and to a much lesser extent his Scrapyard mixtape series there was no doubt in my mind this would be good. I had even made sure not to listen to any of the singles before this album because I didn't want any spoilers, just wanted to go in raw. I listened for the first time almost the second this dropped and then two more times in the following days and I came out crushed every time by just how shit this album was. I cannot for the life of me see where all the love for this album is coming from, I've even seen some people call it better than I Didn't Mean to Haunt You, it's actually three points above it on AOTY at the moment and that's just so insane to me.\nThe flow from song to song in this album took a huge dip from IDMTHY at least in my eyes, some transitions between songs felt super to jarring to me, not just the transitions themselves of course but the song order too just didn't feel right to me. The rapping segments on this album were even more obnoxious than IDMTHY to me at least where I already thought they were about the worst part of any song they were on. Just completely fucks up the atmosphere anytime this guy starts rapping, same with my beloved Danny Brown too unfortunately. In my opinion a lot of this album also felt cheap with lots of reverb thrown onto songs in an attempt to make it somehow more grandiose, I don't know what it did but it definitely didn't feel as huge as it was meant to for me. A last thing I'd like to touch on is the last song, like I'm so sorry to everyone who loves this song but am I insane for thinking it's just a Maruja song?

Snape's relationship with Harry's father is one of the most interesting things in the whole series in my opinion as it really fleshes him out as one of if not the most interesting characters in the whole series. Apart from that though this film felt weak especially coming off the back of the great Goblet of Fire, the dialogue felt more dry (aside from some standouts like Snape and Ron's brothers, like the way Fred delivers \"I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement\" is just so peak). I also really liked the line \"By which time I shall be gone and you shall be dead\", I don't know if it was purposefully funny but it gave me a chuckle, however Dumbledore and Voldemort's fight would've looked a hell of a lot cooler without all those quick cuts and shaky camera movements. For some reason the director (or the author I dunno I've never read Harry Potter sorry) seemed to be going more and more in on moody Harry Potter which wasn't a super interesting character to watch, along with that it just kind of pissed me off how wilfully ignorant the ministry of magic though it's kind of exactly what's happening right now IRL (though I doubt IRL they can just kill the people in charge like they did here).

The CGI is pretty bad too as well as some pretty awful greenscreened scenes. The tone of the film also seemed darker and it definitely felt like it was properly leaning in on being spooky, especially with that train scene which I actually enjoyed however it seemed a bit odd in comparison with the last couple of movies. Another jarring change was the soundtrack this time round which leaned a lot more big band than magical in scenes where it was trying to be all whimsical which I wasn't much a fan of either, came off tacky. Don't much like Hagrid trying to be all emotional either, just doesn't feel very real, nor do really any of the serious moments in this film either because they're undercut by a joke (though at least in this most of the jokes land) or just the actors don't really sell them.

Like sure maybe he's trying to stay strong or whatever but I find it hard to believe anyone wouldn't be a little freaked out by the end of society as we know it on the back of losing a limb. The same goes for most of the cast too, people in this Webtoon feel like they must be AIs or something with how awful their memories are, they're capable of brushing off insane moments in one or two panels and it just doesn't work for me. The story is fine, not much to say about that and the art is pretty bad, definitely doesn't feel nearly as polished as other Webtoons I've read (though I guess in general Webtoons are more a mixed bag as they have so little quality control), there aren't even any backgrounds much of the time and if there are backgrounds it's usually just one or two flat colours."

It's a lot better than the average manhua for example but for a manhwa it's below average and not really doing anything unique nor does it seem to have a proper style at all except \"generic manhwa\". The quality of the art does seem to fluctuate from scene to scene though for some reason, dunno. This has about the most generic you could go for a manhwa, tower mysteriously appears in the middle of the modern world and monsters come out to kill everyone. I dunno if the author thought it'd be fine because he's not writing a manhwa but it came off as super lazy to me and really set the tone for how lazy this was going to be. From there instead of doing anything remotely unique we find out our MC is a generic loser with a bully who has almost zero motivation or reason for the audience to care about him or root against him except for seeing him be mean for no reason a couple times. From there at breakneck pace (deadass three chapters) the MC becomes some sort of unkillable demigod, I don't know what the rush was but it kind of killed any expectation I may have had of this being any good. Not even sure why they bothered starting off with him being a kid if they were going to do this, it'd probably have played better if he started off in his current state and seen his past through flashbacks or dreams or whatever...\nI know I'm getting way too worked up over a shitty manga but it feels like the author is taking a shot at the readers by making this, like it's some kind of inside joke that he's not letting me in on. Reading this made me feel like I was reading Bones again but while Bones felt like it had a focal point it was hurtling towards, this just feels like it's hurtling towards nothing, like I'm floating through space with the absence of anything to latch onto. No interesting story, characters or art direction, just nothing. I have no idea why this was being hyped up so much, it makes me feel a little sad that so many readers of manhwa and manga are willing to not only read dogshit slop like this but then go on to recommend it to other people like it was somehow worth their time. The whole time I was reading this I was waiting for a turning point that I found never arrived and then once I had read all the chapters out right now realised I'd just wasted more than an hour of my life on this.

The whole show is walking a very tight line between being painful to watch and hilarious and honestly many of the episodes, especially those in the first few seasons were just so dry of anything remotely funny. Honestly the entire first season was a shit show, it was way too meanspirited which I don't have a problem with implicitly, I mean the implication scene was super funny and that was dark as shit but I only found it to be funny because it was felt like it was leaning into being silly with Mac's interruptions and Dennis yelling at that old lady. Some of the episodes near the start though were just the gang being evil assholes without enough pushback coming their way imo. Didn't help that Dee hadn't really transformed into the batshit insane version of herself that she is now so she was infinitely less interesting and funny than she is now.\nAfter Frank's breakdown was really when the show started to pick up for me, the whole group dynamic was almost in the place it is now so I felt like jokes just kind of played better with the chemistry between the gang. These days the show is dragging a bit for me though any show would after 16 seasons, it's clearly becoming increasingly more difficult for the writers to think up ways to change the formula they've been using for almost two decades but somehow they still plan on having two more seasons which I'm a little worried about to be honest (though some of the COVID era episodes were great so maybe it won't be two terrible). I can appreciate though how there are some more real moments in the later seasons too, Mac being gay now honestly came off really well to me at least and didn't feel as performative as some other shows I've seen do things relating to politically relevant topics (looking at you Brookyn 99). I don't care what stupid people on Reddit say you can't make me hate this moment, it was pretentious and bizarre and out of character and it was a beautiful fuckin moment of television fuck all of yall some of you guys don't have emotions. I'd have been pissed off if that scene got played for laughs and later on him coming out over and over does get played for laughs so everyone gets what they want, it's pissing me off thinking about how this episode pissed people off. I also really like the scene of Charlie breaking down about his dad in season 15, it was a performance I hadn't expected from this show but it was passionate and just a really strong showing from the actor playing him so I didn't even mind it being over the top dramatic with the pouring rain and bagpipes. If you had just shown me the first season I'd never have expected such a moment, even manages to be funny too. Truly the show of all time, best watched in the form of compilations on Youtube."

The transitions between scenes and especially the shitty dubbing when the characters are far away or walking down hills or whatever really take me out of the movie.

In movies there's already that separation between them and reality so the pressure of a combat scene is lessened unless it's really well done, as you know there is no inherent danger to the actor. But in this film there's even more separation, the only good guys truly in danger were the little girl and that guy operating the little bug drone, and while I admit I did feel nervous watching the bug drone pilot piloting it out in open, by the time the girl was properly in danger the stakes had become so high that I really didn't care if she survived or not.\nThis isn't even mentioning that every character was shockingly undeveloped, I didn't know anything about anyone except for knowing Powell is an obsessive freak, Jesse Pinkman and that lady seem painfully ill prepared for their job and that one British white lady is annoying.

My main complaint about this one was that it was just too uncomfortable and tense at times for my taste, kind of made some scenes tough watches especially that one dinner scene, but when Landa shows up and the drums start up, holy fuck, really makes the scene for me. Especially how the drums just stop when it pans over to Goebbels telling a joke, too peak. Landa is such a good character dude it's insane, Waltz absolutely deserved that Oscar, he really made the character and carried the scenes he was in. It'd also be nice if this film was a little shorter, but in the same vein I doubt its story and the way Tarantino told it could've been shortened all that much. I might've just picked an inopportune time to watch it as I got interrupted a few times so its flow got lost a little for me."

Reservoir Dogs is not as good as Pulp Fiction, though that kind of goes without saying as being better than the best film of all time is quite the challenge but I still felt a bit disappointed after finishing it. However, I sat with it for a day or two and realised this was a good fuckin film, though I felt the cast of characters weren't exactly as funny and charismatic together as Jules and Vincent, I still didn't have a single character I disliked (except for maybe Mr. Blonde but him being an evil dickhead was on purpose and he got what was coming to him in the end which was nice. Sidenote, he looks scarily similar to the guy who plays Rigsby in The Mentalist, it's crazy.) There's a lot of real funny moments in this film too especially when it's just them fucking around and having a good time, you really feel like you get to know the characters in moments like that along with the brilliant introductions which a few of them get. My favourite has got to be Mr Orange's, Tim Roth acts his ass off and the whole learning and telling the story with it coming to life as he gets into character is so simple but such an awesome scene. \n My only proper issue is don't like how much torture and people bleeding out and dying goes on in this, it's just so hard to watch and I'm sure that was the point but that doesn't make it easier to see. Maybe I'm going through male menopause I dunno, I know the Pulp Fiction rape dungeon scene is a bit similar but it didn't feel as brutal as when Mr Blonde was torturing that cop or when Mr Orange was bleeding out and crying in pain and shit. The cool use of diegetic music in the torture scene and in general did lighten this film up though, it feels very intentional and its the little stuff like that making me feel more immersed in films. I also really liked the kind of non-linear storytelling in this one, it's not quite as disjointed as Pulp Fiction but the story kind of being told and then that section being shown thirty minutes later is cool and pretty unique I felt. The ending was pretty tragic but felt right, great film."

Despite all having the same aesthetic and pretty similar beats on most song, every song managed to stay reasonably varied with a crowded and constantly morphing style of production (not a bad thing). Egotrip is a pretty perfect length for an album too at about 40 minutes which makes it avoid feeling monotonous. The rapping on this is reminiscent of McKinley Dixon on Beloved! Paradise!

The art is jawdroppingly pretty, it does have some of the lingering characteristics of an later 90s early 2000s manga with a more comic book-like style but it still has some crazy ass panels especially when RJ is playing music, it can be super awesome when it wants. Its also cool to have a story this good about someone so important to blues music and to see the kind of world he lived in (more the racism part less the devil being real part) though admittedly I don't actually like his music all that much. Clyde of Bonnie and Clyde fame was there too... dunno why, don't think he was in the original legend he was just here but his and RJ's friendship was always a highlight though they were only really friends for ten or so chapters. My main issue is that sometimes the pacing feels a little off and makes it a bit hard to tell what is going on at any given second but that may also be because I read all 30 or so chapters that have been released so far in about an hour or two.

Pretty unexpectedly banger album for me, for some reason I assumed this would be a rap album (it had a Danny Brown feature after all (btw the Danny Brown feature fitted unexpectedly well, I was a little worried but it ended up being for nothing)) but this turned out to be a banger of an art pop album. Honestly reminded me a lot of Bladee's Crest but felt a lot more atmospheric (might be the wrong word, Crest is pretty atmospheric too but just a different atmosphere I guess), moody and heavy but it worked in Quadeca's favour especially because of the topics touched upon on this album.\nThe whole concept of Quadeca having died and looking back on his life with regret is such a unique idea and is really added to with the powerful lyrics and banger production. I don't exactly have the vocabulary to express well enough how I felt listened to this wonderful album (which does bring into question why I'm reviewing music in the first place but shhh), you might just have to trust that its great and if you don't feel like trusting me just listen to my favourite song on the album, tell me a joke.

The front story, on the other hand, is extremely generic. The guy is OP because the author wants the 12 year olds to be able to use him as a self insert to pretend they aren't losers. The author tries to get you invested in the main character so he can do his edgy bullshit, but the bullying is comical more than anything. I've both never been bullied and don't live in Korea, so for all I know it could be a shithole but I have eyes and have seen bullying, both physical and mental, and unless the people bullying you are fucking stupid, they aren't going to do it the way the main character is shown being bullied here. \n The dialogue is just bad, the characters are shallow, and the protagonist is too busy being covered in blood and making his eyes red and shit for me to be able to care about him. I highly doubt the author did any work on the dialogue and I don't blame him because the audience he is trying to get by writing this probably doesn't care about it nor has the reading comprehension above a third grade level to even tell the difference between this and well written dialogue.

This manhwa has so many cool ass long panels, I attached one below but there are are dozens I could've picked from. The fight scenes in particular are always a highlight of any chapter that has them, they're bright and over the top, all I could want from a murim fight. Not just that though, even some more mundane scenes end up looking crazy because this artist seems to have a real aptitude for making long ass horizontal panels that really bring you into this manhwa in a way I don't think I've ever seen done to quite the same extent before. I also really liked the way facial expressions are done, it really adds to the weird, awkward vibes that every interaction has. Little grins and facial movements that feels so unnatural but still manage to make me believe that just maybe these weirdos could have something behind their eyes after all really make this for me. \n I recommend Absolute Regression, but if you don't enjoy the dialogue between the father and son in the first five or so chapters I'd just give up right there because you'd be wasting your time reading any more.

The recordings felt a lot more polished and clean and the vibes in general were a lot more upbeat so it was easier to consume. Reminded me of 70s Bowie too, glam rock shouldn't have died out we need more of it please. Even with this though I'm unsure I'll be coming back to this very often, it feels a lot more bloated than it should be but I guess making horribly bloated albums is CSHR's whole thing. This feels like it could've easily been 10 or 20 minutes shorter with very little actual impact, probably would even improve it. The almost 20 minute long Planet Desperation could and in my opinion really should have been split up into five or six songs as each section feels disconnected and varies in quality."

I wouldn't say he's a good singer but in the same way that Cameron Winter or Phil Elverum aren't great singers either (imo ofc don't come after me please), that their vocals are so unique and different that it kind of makes up for it and even makes it better than if they were perfect with smooth voices and perfectly hitting the notes. I think a perfect example of this is Slush Puppy, King Krule's voice really carries this song and his weird tone and almost anguished crying vocals near the end absolutely add to the vulnerable and heavy atmosphere. It could've benefited from some trimming lengthwise but it's not a huge issue and doesn't drag too much, I deadass cannot believe Fantano gave this a 4 😭 are we deadass right now."

The singing on the other hand is consistency very Steely Dan, super lively and unique.\nMy favourites here were probably Only A Fool Would Say That and Fire In The Hole, the latter's groovy, blusey piano had my attention in a chokehold the whole way through and even gave off some Hunky Dory vibes. The former's bossa nova influence (I think) was a good time too though it lacked the tension Fire In The Hole did. Do It Again and the last three weren't as strong as the rest of the bunch though which brought my score down a little, just didn't do anything that I thought was interesting nor were they very catchy but they weren't bad my any means either, maybe just some nice background music."

For some reason though, instead of going with fun over the top, the movie decided to go with depressing and uncomfortable which made the over-the-topness come off more corny than funny. \nThe girl did pretty well especially considering how young the actor seemed though, but by no fault of hers the script seems to be on some fucked up anti Madoka Magica shit where instead of a 14 year old acting like a 5 year old this 12 year old acts old and jaded as shit. Maybe I was just a stupid ass 12 year old or something but Matilda seems way to into smoking and wanting to kill herself for a 12 year old even if she's had a fucked life and its a little jarring. \n The weird 12 year old having a crush on her old ass father figure was fucked too and didn't help the movies situation making it infinitely more uncomfortable to watch. I'm sure they were going for something with Matilda being a kid and having confusing emotions n shit but it was weird and deeply disturbing which are both things I don't go out in search for.

Despite this I found Forever Howlong to be enjoying and their change in direction to be intriguing (even if I preferred their previous style more).\nThis album still had some of their bombastic moments where everything is blaring all at once but it also leans more chamber folk and chamber pop than I felt in the previous, some moments in Two Horses especially had me reminded of Laura Marling's most recent album. I'm also told this has some baroque pop in it though I don't know what that means so just make of that what you will. Besties has managed to grow on me and might be my favourite song on the album now (For the Cold Country is a runner up too, wonderful song) despite hating it when first released. Charlie's voice is great and while I do miss Issac's bizarre vocalisations and cries I think she does a great job filling his seat.\nDespite my praise I find myself wanting more from Forever Howlong, it's a really good album but I just feel like it doesn't go down as smooth as Ants From Up There or even Live at Bush Hall. It even felt like it dragged a little at some points (Mary and Nancy Tries to Take the Night especially, don't like either of those songs much at all, though at least Nancy Tries to Take the Night builds decently but it can't really make up for the energy lost by its boring ass start).

The instrumentation is wonderful even if the singing is a little nasally and raw for me and you can really hear the how much influence this had directly or indirectly from Surfjan Stevens to Arcade Fire. The recording does feel a little muffling at some moments I'd have liked some more accordion like the first song (at least I think it's accordion) but I guess it's a folk album so lots of guitar should be expected. The Fool is getting majorly slept on by the way and was probably my favourite track, really felt like it was helping with the already great flow this album had. The heavy mic clipping drums on songs like Holland, 1945 are also pretty sick too and something I want to see more of in modern music, even felt a little reminiscent of Deathconsciousness.\nEdit: 8 -> 7, none of the songs really stuck with me."

'Remember when we lost the keys and you lost more than that in my backseat baby' is the funniest line of all time though that shit is so stupid that it looped around and I think it might be genius."

I also lowkey expected 'In a Row' to be way more heavy like 'Punish' by Ethal Cain, I'm not quite sure why I expected that, it kind of felt like it was building to that so it was a tad disappointing to hear a less explosive ending than expected... Aside from that Glory seems to lose a lot of steam by the end which was a little sad too. Better luck next time.\nEdit: 6.5 -> 7.5, this album grew on me a lot. I still agree with my assessment that it loses steam by the end but I didn't emphasise quite enough how high its peaks are. In a Row and Clean Heart especially are two of the best songs that I've not only heard this year but perhaps even this decade.

I'm also quite enjoying the story, it's unique and keeps me guessing as well as somehow managing to feel less over-the-top Tumblr-lesbian than other Western comics despite girls kissing all the time in extremely over-the-top ways, it's quite odd (I know that vibe usually comes from Webtoons but still). It helps that all the characters a just cool as hell too, Allison with all the scars and long white hair looks sick, sad she got the lesbian cut so soon 😢, Incubus is such a sexy mf with his big ass star earring and White Chain with the prayer beads?!!? All I know is one day I wish to reach their level of drip. \n The characters also happen to just be unapologetically cool while still having room to develop which is something a lot of comics, manga especially struggle with. Them kicking ass and having their ass kicked are both equally fun to watch, the fights are great especially later on, some of the best I've ever read. They are just so giant and explosive they're a joy to read. The world itself is pretty wacky and fun too, maybe it's just because I've read a lot of manga but I haven't seen something like this wild and diverse in characters and world design since I read Saga. My only big issue was sometimes I found the story a little hard to follow, though it may just be due to how illiterate I am. There was just a lot going on though, lots of panels felt like some were's Waldo shit and it was sometimes to the comic's detriment even if it's undoubtedly cool to look at a big ass battle with so much shit going on.

I don't know what I was smoking on when I first listened to this but I found myself really enjoying it this time. 'The National Anthem' horn section was a real highlight and 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' was a wonderfully bleak final song (if you don't count the bonus track of course). I can't really see where the hype around 'How to Disappear Completely' is coming from but it might just take me a while to get it, who knows."

When I last checked this had just as many 100s as it had 0s so I seeing that I had to wonder if this was as bad as people were making it out to be or instead maybe people just saw the cover and gave it a 0 without giving the album a chance.\nI thought the production here was very solid or at least unique most of the time, much more so than their previous EP which I heard a couple songs from a little while back. The rest of it though, I'm not so sure about. I thought the vocals were pretty mediocre, I might just be saying that because the guy's British though, not 100% sure and while I appreciate how confident this guy is in his sexuality I still couldn't help but feel uncomfortable sitting through the freaky gay furry sex album sadly so that ended up really putting a damper on how much enjoyment I could pull from this.\nThe lyrics don't really have any real substance to be found in them, this guy clearly just wanted to make a fun silly project and I'd say he achieved it even if I personally didn't find it all that fun. It'd be pretty silly for me to sit here and trying to read into such wonderful lyrics as 'I guess yiff imitates life' but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have liked it more if there was some meaning behind the songs. Obviously not really the place to be looking for that though of course but a man can dream.\nIf you're into the genre and don't feel any discomfort hearing about how much Pent Up Pup wants to fuck I'm sure this album will be a really fun time but unfortunately it's not for me. Happy valentines to everyone reading this, it's already over for me and I had a pretty good one, I hope it goes well for you all too and if a good valentines day for you is having a fursuit orgy more power to you."

This album is absolutely great and I can see exactly where all the hype around Ethel was coming from. \nAmerican Teenager pulled me out of what I was up to and forced me to and provide this album with my complete focus and for its entire hour runtime it was like Ethel had me in a stranglehold. Ethel's voice is wonderful and the recording is on point. Many sections of the narrative on the other hand were interesting but didn't resonate with me personally, not to say for something to resonate you'd have to had experienced it personally but as someone who had a fairly uneventful but happy youth in a atheistic household some lyrics about religion or familial turmoil are so far detached from my own experiences that they're difficult to grasp.\nI hope Ethel Cain makes more stuff like this in the future though I'm not quite sure what direction she intends to go in at this point, and after hearing Perverts I won't say my expectations are completely marred but they'll be at least a little toned down for her following projects."

Just to be clear this is the first Ethel Cain project I've heard so I don't really have much to compare it with, I also was not aware that this was a drone album beforehand because I had my head in the sand or something so that came as a surprise. I found Punish brilliant so I was very excited for this to drop and I hate to say it but I left disappointed. I guess I shouldn't have gone in expecting the level of energy from the lead single throughout the entire album but the first song being glitched up radio sounds and wind noises for the first five minutes was not on my expectation bingo card. To be completely honest I'm not even sure I'd consider most of the title track to be a song at all and that's not a good thing. It was mysterious sure but it didn't really get me very interested nor did I have any idea what was going on. Perhaps I was meant to 'get' it after having finished the album but I didn't. I did like the last two or so minutes a lot more though, sounded like something was actually happening.\nPunish as mentioned was brilliant, have had it on repeat since release and it's certainly the highlight of this project. The synth was wonderful and I love it through and through. It even managed to feel like its placement in the track list made sense which I was a little worried about when I was about halfway through the title track. Punish is also lyrically interesting despite me being unable to relate to the situation Ethel is speaking of. I'm sure the other tracks are well done lyrically too but Punish is the only one with lyrics right now and I'm a lazy bum who prefers to read lyrics off a page that someone else has written down.\nI'm not quite sure about Houseofpsychoticwomn, it feels like a repeat of the title track in that instead of being a song its a repeating sound with Ethel whispering mind bending messages in my ears. The repeating sound made it sound like I was spinning or something and it was really annoying lowkey. Ethel said she loved me though so +1 points (ily too Ethel). The droning synth at the end was also pretty cool.\nVacillator felt like we were getting back on track, it's a slow nice nice listen that doesn't constitute psychological torture and Onanist was even better, it was ethereal, heavy and all round great. Stuff like it really helped me not have a stroke and die during this album though to be honest at some points it got a little staticy for my liking if that's the word. Not a big fan of the two minutes Ethel ASMR at the end of the track either though I'm sure 'it feels good' has some deep meaning, maybe something to do with the whole abuse throughline going on that I'm not smart enough to decipher.\nPulldrone was another spoken word section which if you haven't guessed by now I'm not a fan of. Not much to say, I wasn't listening too carefully so I didn't really know what was going on, ouroboros or something, I'm quite the reviewer I know. Tragically I hadn't liked the album enough up until that point to care too much. Then Ethel used a weedwacker that became bagpipes near the end for the rest of the song. The end.\nEtienne was a nice instrumental track with random rambling from some guy who sounded like he was behind a pane of glass at the end. Not much to say about it. Thatorchia had some nice heavy synths like Punish did but never matched Punishes freak sadly :(, it was just synth and some vocalization. Amber Waves was a wonderful end to this album, slow and beautiful which I think are the two best attributes Ethel gives her songs in this album.\nI saw some people commenting about how sad it was, I didn't really feel that. Saddest part about listening to this album is that I got Hypixel level 125 while listening to it. I clearly need to get out more. This album isn't bad, if it was I probably would have turned it off midway through, it certainly had something interesting going on, but I can't see myself returning to it and I wasn't a fan of the long ass drone tracks at all. Certainly didn't make me excited to check out more of Ethel in the future."

I think this might have hit a lot harder too if they actually broke up but due to me living in the future I know they didn't.\nEdit: 8 -> 9, this album has grown on me a lot, some of the rawest and most passionate performances from James here especially on all my friends (this might be my favourite version of that song). Just an incredible album over all, I still stand by my previous criticisms but I think the quality of this album kind of overrules them.\nEdit: 9 -> 10, fuck my life. While it's still not exactly something I'd call a perfect album I'd say that the long goodbye is a testament to how fucking good this band is. The fact that this three hour long smorgasbord of an album has maybe five misses for me is so insane and it's not just all my friends that had the best version of it on this, there are so many: dance yrself clean, you can't hide (which is a live original I believe but still), i can change, you wanted a hit, tribulations, someone great, all i want, home and that's just a shortlist of my favourites. There are so many great reimagined parts of songs in here (some of which took some taking used to admittedly but grew on me). I know I'm kind of rambling but I dunno really what to say, it's just so peak. Go listen to the original home and then this albums nightcore sped up remix and contemplate or something."

They aren't particularly bad or anything but their music is just so god damn boring, the instrumentals especially which is a shame because some of their songs are like full 30 minutes of instrumentals.\nSome points in this album are just so unbelievably repetitive it borders on annoying. Like how can the first 7 minutes of Rope just be the same strum with a boring drone in the background and the singer channelling a demon or yodelling or some shit, it feels too simple and empty and it really drags. Even when it started to ramp up and get all over the top and shit (my favourite part of every post-rock album), it feels like Swans overdid it. Maybe it was because the recording I'm listening to is just so horrifically low quality but it just sounds like an endless washed out wall of painful sound.\nI'll still listen to their new album when it eventually drops but my expectations have never been lower. Now, time to hype myself up to talk to my racist uncles who I see once a year in a few hours, wish me luck."

I wasn't reading the lyrics so I can't really comment on them but I was just having a fun time with it so it's alright.\nMy main complaints are kind of incoherent and not very constructive but to me a few of the songs sound kind of uninteresting, I wasn't as big a fan of the second half of the album as I was the first, a few of the songs started sounding like some Canadian System of a Down or Green Day knockoff. Didn't like how skin was just a distorted poem and the recording (on the first song especially) is kind of liquidy if you get what I mean (???) which led me to not really enjoy it.

God I hope my goat isn't washed but from where I'm standing this seems like the beginning of the end.\nEdit: 7 -> 8, you know what, this has grown on me a fair bit.

Even without a deep understanding of the album during my first listen it was still kind of great?? I'm not really one for chamber music or folk so I don't really know how this weighs up in comparison to any other albums but this album certainly had me almost transfixed at some points, only being broken out of the immersion by track five and six which while not bad at all just seem to have a different vibe or something?

Maybe they could have been put in an extra EP or something. The thing that ruined Redeyes for me was its really piercing noise playing over the like whole second half that of ruined the flow after a very good start with The Demon.

    "description": "Maybe I just don't get it but the whole first 10 or so minutes felt like just a continuous and painful stream of sounds which was pretty disorienting, if that was the point and if so good job. After that though I started enjoying it more, it started sounding kind of mystical and ethereal which was a nice recovery period for my blown out ear drums though 'a desire part 1' went on a bit too long. In general I also think this album sounded perhaps a little uncoordinated too, though I'm no music reviewer so maybe that was me missing the point again lol. I think my favourite songs were 'untitled-++++++ (or sorrow / intermission)'and 'untitled-+++++++++ (or nothing, version d / forgo)' (especially the latter). That song went hard and pulled this thing up like a full point."

I don't know why people love this so much, maybe I'll need to relisten at some point.\n4.5 -> 7.5, sorry I don't think I really gave this record a chance when I first heard it but I decided to listen to it again after really enjoying Phil's newest project Night Palace recently. Based on what I've heard from Phil, being Night Palace and A Crow Looked at Me, it often feels a lot more like Phil is a poet than a musician. For this reason I've never really felt like listening to his music in album form has done as much for me as it has for other people. A Crow Looked at Me especially, but Night Palace too had moments that just felt like words spoken to instrumentals without much connection between the two. The Glow, Pt. 2, on the other hand feels a lot more in sync with the music aspect of it so it's easier to digest as an album without losing the very human feel of Phil's music (though that might be my way of saying shit recording quality, not that I particularly mind) or his beautiful songwriting. The instrumentals also felt very intimate and personal on this record like Phil was in the room with me or something. Despite this, I'm scoring slightly lower than Night Palace as I think Phil's songwriting there was a lot more interesting and engaging for me to dig into, making Night Palace feel more replayable. I also found the subject matter of Night Palace more interesting."

The director seems quite proficient, I'm not really knowledgeable enough about film to say whether that's actually the case or I'm just being deceived by how artsy this thing is but it definitely feels that way. The shots are interesting and especially colourful, I think the use of a proper array of colours is just about the best choice the director made as if this film was just greys and browns it'd have been a much less engaging watch. Aside from that however the movie didn't seem particularly good at much else, the story was certainly there but it wasn't super memorable, nor were the characters despite the main ones being wacky weirdos. The pacing also felt a little all over the place to me. Not to mention while this thing being artsy was often to its benfit, there were also some moments like watching a childbirth that could've been cut out, maybe that's just the price of watching a French film though. Could've been better, could've been worse."

Fantastic Mr. Fox is a jaw-droppingly beautiful film with its stop motion and unique aesthetic which make it something I doubt we'll ever see again. The way you can almost feel the amount of effort put into every frame makes watching this film worthwhile to check out. Aside from that though the story, while rather simple is very human despite the characters being foxes. That scene where Mr Fox talks about not wanting to live in a hole anymore, aside from just being a brilliantly shot scene with that single viewpoint of Mr Fox reading the paper, really made me really feel for Mr Fox. His concerns felt very real and considering animals in the film live their proper animal lifespans I can understand his urgency, that detail also makes it make sense why everyone's darting around and shit aside from it being funny to watch and making stop motion easier. These guys are going to live for like seven years, got to make the most out of it (even if it ends up fucking everything up and making Mr Fox come to the realisation that he is quite a lot more domesticated than he thought). Love this film."

Last season was kind of a step down but still a great show, rip Andre Braugher.\nEdit: Just rewatched this show and I think I might have some more to say (not that I really said anything at all last time). First off, this show was funny when I first saw it at 13 and remains funny now. I also think it actually peaks pretty late on in season four or maybe even season five. I mean that moment when Holt says he should've fired Terry in season five's Halloween episode remains one of the funniest moments in any show I've ever seen. The characters are pretty interesting too, they learn things and they change across the show, not much mind you but it's a sitcom so anything at all is nice to see. I've seen the show take the most shit for it being \"woke\" which I totally agree with but I feel like for the majority of the show, while it mightn't have been all that subtle, it at least still felt sincere and pretty funny too when worked into jokes like when the warden talks about how trans people are treated in prison with Jake. Shits funny and relevant, it's awesome. But in the last season it starts to feel more forced, like the first episode of season eight was so bad I fully stopped watching the show after it despite it being my favourite show of all time at that time. This might also just be my dislike for Rosa talking when I say this though as it was a pretty Rosa-centric. Also I've just gotta say, Rosa is such a terrible character, she has nearly no actually interesting elements about her despite the writers trying so hard to make it work over and over. She feels like a walking stereotype but unlike Scully for example who is also basically a character trope as a person, she keeps getting played serious during important scenes. It has never once felt right to me though because of how she's been basically boxed in as a character who doesn't express all that many emotions apart from anger and annoyance. Last episode almost made me cry though so don't listen to anything bad I said."

The sub isn't less cringy it's just harder to judge cringe when you're reading it as opposed to hearing it.\nEdit: 3 -> 8, I think stockholm kicked in or something but I pushed through the corn and it led me to realise Attack on Titan really is something special. I can't really explain it but AOT is strangely captivating to me even if it took me a while to 'get' it.\nEdit 4: Ok I just rewatched it once more and I gotta rattle off some things, not changing the score at this point because honestly it's still probably an eight, just gotta complain. First off I just gotta say I wish Eren was a more likeable character, he felt like a whiny piece of shit the whole time and his change to being actually deplorable would've worked a lot better if I had liked him in the first place. I've seen some people compare his transformation to Walter's in Breaking Bad but the difference for me is that I actually liked Walter so it had an impact when everything started going downhill, here I was just happy to see him fail. Secondly there are so many moments that just had me confused, Armin surviving the massive fall after being burnt to a crisp, Reiner being able to transfer his consciousness, Eren not reverting Zeke's pure titans instantly despite telling Connie he'd revert his mum, Eren being able to use the founders power to attack Reiner despite not touching any titan of royal blood, people from Paradis not having different accents to Marleyans and Eren not starting the rumbling in Marley, these are just off the dome too. I'm sure some of these have explanations but when I've Googled them it didn't get cleared up at all. For Eren not reverting the pure titans the most feasible explanation was that he just forgot because clearly Zeke's spinal fluid didn't stop him as he could save Connie's mum. Eren being able to use founding powers while not touching a titan of royal blood was explained by some guy saying that founding powers are like a battery and he just had a little bit of charge left to kill of Reiner with which seems like bullshit to me as the moment Zeke died the rumbling stopped. Rest of them just feel like bullshit with no explanation so I won't even bother. I'm not angry about weird things happening in a fantasy story, I'm angry about them being inconsistent. Last thing I gotta rattle off is I'm so pissed off that people shit on MAPPA's work for the last part of AOT, even with the CGI it looked way better than all the previous seasons, it's like people are forgetting the terrible riding scenes with the clearly 2D trees."

It was clear far too much focus had been placed on the fight scenes and everything else was on the back burner. I also felt that many scenes were suffering from overuse of that blur affect, maybe it was to save time or something but it just looked dreadful, not to mention the random darkness which I heard was forced by the Japanese government for epilepsy or something so I really shouldn't complain about it but I don't care, it ruined multiple fight scenes for me in just how jarring it was, really took me out of it. The second fight between Gojo and Toji was cool though, felt like the extra stylised approach they went with really paid off, I also really liked the fight with Gojo in the train station, the jazzy ass infinite void sequence was so peak. The Sukuna vs Volcano guy was pretty sick as well along with the fight between Toji and Megumi, the ending was pretty sweet too, these cool moments don't cancel out just how weak the non fighting moments are generally. Sukuna vs Mahoraga however was honestly exhausting to watch, it went on for so long and followed so many other long and intense fights that it was hard to focus on no matter how \"good\" the animation was (though to be honest personally I found it hard to follow, it was perhaps over animated). The story was about on par with season one, maybe a little less streamlined. I also might just be remembering wrong but I don't remember season one having a narrator and the narrator this time round was absolutely terrible, I mean the guy himself did a fine job but just the whole idea of a narrator giving out random exposition was a bad one. The Mei Mei grooming scene put a bad taste in my mouth too. Sorry this whole edit was so disjointed, I've been writing it as I watch and can't really be bothered patching it up."

Better than every recent open world game.\nEdit: 8.5 -> 4.5, well I must have been criminally insane when I first played this game because it fuckin sucks. It looks good and runs well but really that's about it, it has a big open world but most of the time you'll just be running through what feels like the same place over and over again. The combat feels worse than The Witcher 2, none of the hits felt all that impactful at all, and the entire first like two hours feels like one big tutorial in which the game does a lot more telling than showing with popup after popup. Maybe if it had a better UI it wouldn't feel the need to tell me every little thing off the bat but alright man. A lot of the controls also just feel counter-intuitive, like whoever decided to use the middle mouse for the crossbow is completely insane. I also just didn't really enjoy the bosses I fought, having always enjoyed humanoid bosses which is probably why I enjoyed Eredin so much but moments like that in this game are few and far between. I would have also been fine with something like Monster Hunter where it feels like I'm just as much of a monster as the enemy but alas here it kind of just feels like I'm going through the motions, poking a big beast with a twig until it finally falls over, being able to slice through enemies was pretty cool though. Things like needing to make potions also just fucking sucks in every game it's a part of, tedium just to pad the runtime so I generally just don't do it. If you're feigning for a large open world story-centric game Skyrim is and has always been a better option I'm sorry to say, this games just about as buggy as Skyrim too with NPCs in a near constant state of being forced into idle poses and glitching around the place or enemies deciding to take flight. No wonder Cyberpunk was such a shitshow at launch. This all isn't even mentioning that I don't really like the story all that much and that's saying something when I enjoyed Guild Wars 2's fuckass story."

    "description": "Some of the most fun combat in any video game, it even manages to make feudal Japan seem like a fun place to be. My main complaint is that I was punished for dying and that really made it way less fun to play, instead of experimenting I was watching tutorials on the optimal ways to do things instead.\nEdit: 6 -> 7, after not enjoying Elden Ring I decided to give Sekiro another shot and honestly I liked it more this time. Previously I quit before like even the halfway point so I really lost out on a lot of cool experiences. This time round I've played both the true (I think) ending and the Shura ending so I'm pretty sure I have a decent grasp on the game at this point. Firstly I enjoyed the game's bosses a lot and a hell of a lot more than those in Elden Ring, they were generally pretty reasonably sized so FromSoftware's inability to make cameras work didn't become noticeable, and there were even giant bosses I did enjoy because it doubled down on the spectacle and made the fight part secondary. Also you were standing far enough away to read the dragon's attacks. Of course there were bosses I didn't love, generally due to their size. Gyoubu Oniwa had a little jank, luckily he was pretty easy and had such a bombastic personality that I can forgive it, Demon of Hatred was a lot worse however and was probably my least favourite boss fight in the game despite how cool it looked especially when this fuckin guy had a trillion HP. The Guardian Ape was like 10% too big too and there were attacks like his sweeping attack that you could dodge and yet it didn't even look like your guy actually dodged it which felt a little weird. The rest of the lineup however was great though and really complimented the awesome rhythm game-like style of combat.\nUnfortunately combat is only half of this game though (more like three fifths but shhh).\nFromSoftware made the brave choice to add stealth to their game while not knowing or caring enough to actually add stealth to their game. Enemies in this game are all idiots who have the memories of goldfish and can have a murder committed five meters away and still not notice. It's not immersive at all and is generally a pretty tedious process so I'd have just had preferred no stealth at all. I'm aware that it's optional but it also happens to be optimal in many points so you kind of just end up doing it.\nIn my previous comment about the game I hadn't really talked about the way the levels were built which I found pretty impressive (though not built super well around the stealth system apart from grass sometimes). Despite most of them being rather linear, there are moments where you can split off into branching paths and find new cool stuff and areas like the other FromSoftware games which is fun. On my first playthrough there were even bosses I managed to miss which was honestly pretty cool, made the world feel more expansive than it really was. There are some pretty hidden paths (they seemed that way at least to me) that made progression a little weird though, near the beginning I found a door that was locked and at that point I had thought I exhausted every area available to me so I was stuck and had to watch a video on how to go further which was a sucky feeling. I'm sure if I spent another hour hunting around I would've found the correct way but sadly I don't have infinite time to play video games these days. Performance in some of these areas was pretty terrible too, I don't have the best PC but it was strange how I was able to get a constant 60 FPS on Elden Ring at medium graphics anywhere and yet in some parts of this game I had to go to low and still sometimes couldn't get 60 FPS. Thankfully this wasn't an issue in boss fights but frankly this shouldn't be an issue at all and more optimisation work probably should've been done. Like how is it that any explosion immediately slows my PC to a crawl? I also just hate that fucking gun area it ruined my life for like thirty minutes and made me more pissed off than any other part of the game. I also straight up died more times to that miniboss with the gun the first time more than any other boss in the entire game. Maybe I was just having a stroke.\nThe story was a lot more interesting than other FromSoftware games as is the trend for this game at this point. This is largely not because the story is actually good and more because it's told to me in a comprehensible way instead of needing to scrounge for breadcrumbs like in previous (and unfortunately future) FromSoftware games. The rendered cutscenes were pretty too but that's not specific to this game I guess.\nNow I'm just gonna rattle off some more miscellaneous complains which are the reasons this can't get scored any higher (for now at least). You will find that most of the problems here are just that it was made by FromSoftware but what can you do I guess. Firstly, as usual, the glyphs are always XBOX even if I have a Playstation controller plugged in. I should not be needing to install mods for things like this especially not on a game that costed $50 even on sale. Secondly, while it's not as bad as in the souls games the UI is cramped as fuck and I'd prefer some more built in tutorials for things rather than just reading a bunch of textboxes which could be the least immersive part of any game other than leaving the game to Google what to do. Thirdly remnants are such a bad feature that the game would've been better just not having them, I don't know why FromSoftware insists on adding online functions to every game they make but the only affect they've had on the world for me is that now there are loads and loads of purple bits everywhere and none of them have anything meaningful to say. Its to the point where I just turn online mode off but it just feels bizarre for them to exist at all. The audio in this game is pretty terrible too, not the audio itself, in fact it's generally pretty good even if the music doesn't reach the highs of other entries in this series, but the volume of sounds are completely fucked, the sound of finishing an enemy is so horribly loud I had to turn the sound volume down but since it's so much louder than the rest of the audio in this game suddenly I can't really hear anything except a more reasonably loud finish sound effect. For a game priced $100 when not on sale I expect things like this to not be issues which is why it's so odd to me when I constantly find nagging problems like these. How hard could it possibly have been to add two sliders, one for combat sounds and one for ambience like walking? Finally I still dislike losing half my EXP (from the current level I'm on) and half of my money at death. It forces me to spend it all before boss fights which means if I don't have enough to get something I'm going to have to grind trash enemies which is such a boring aspect and really doesn't fit at all and is especially weird when the rest of the game has pretty great pace. The only reason I can think of is that FromSoftware wanted to ensure they could use their current tools properly before letting them play around with new stuff but to me it just makes the game less fun so I had to fight the urge to install a mod to disable this feature. I'd be fine with it if there was a way to collect this money and EXP lost like in other souls games but you just can't. Unless you get lucky it's just gone forever... This is only compounded by dragonrot which certainly is a feature. It's so weird, it kind of does nothing especially because you can cure it so easily so it just kind of feels like it's there to waste my time??"

I've finally got back into Guild Wars 2 and it's just as I remember for better or worse. Firstly, the new expansions are pretty mediocre (not that I had high hopes for the story) to be honest but the weapons are pretty cool, especially the new spears in JW. There are less bosses than I'd have expected which was a bit disappointing but Cerus is really cool even if I'm too trash to do him in challenge mode. Now to talk about some issues with this game I'd left out of my original comment. This game is like really easy, there are challenge motes that up the anti a fair bit but I'd have had liked if there was some of that challenge in the open world because what's even the point of level-scaling if the enemies still don't do damage to me. It makes early game a slog especially because that's probably the point in the game where you'd be doing the least banding together with other people which is the most fun part of GW2. I also have to take a minute to complain about the Living World DLCs because they're sick as hell (especially episode 4) but for some reason they decided to not be normal and force me to buy them via the in game shop and either in a bundle or one by one and like who is buying these one by one. It's so bizarre to me. Anyway sorry for shitting on GW2 so much, do bear in mind I consider it a 9.5 still I just like complaining a lot more than I do complimenting things because complaining is very easy."

    "description": "Prior to me writing this this was a 2000 word long insane rambling about Elden Ring but I've cooled my head since and given the game another shot and decided I don't really hate it as much as I had thought. I still don't really think it's good but it's certainly not bad either. Let me get out of the way first that the game looks great, every fight looks great and most look better than previous FromSoftware games so when I'm talking about anything assume that on top of whatever I say it looks really good. The UI, also really good.\nDuring my first playthrough I think my big mistake was playing this like Dark Souls when it really isn't, though I would have liked it more if it shared a little more DNA with Dark Souls. Obviously I was aware that the game was open world but I still kind of treated it like I shouldn't explore too much which I do recognise was a mistake but at the same time not wanting to explore much of the open world doesn't really bode well for the open world. It kind of felt like they had the content for maybe three regions max and yet they felt the need to add nine which led to a lot of dungeons and moments being straight up identical with a different item I couldn't use at the end. It was messed up how many times I had a cool moment like finding a Tibia Mariner floating around a bunch of broken down buildings only to have that experience like five more times to the point that it didn't even feel special. I'd also had liked if they put a little more work into the minibosses you find around the world because I would've have minded fighting so many Tibia Mariners if it wasn't the most boring boss of all time every time, Erdtree Avatar's were always fun at least. This goes double for dragons because finding the first dragon about thirty minutes into my first playthrough after being warned don't go into that lake you'll fuckin die was such an awesome thing and to be honest it still does make me a little giddy thinking about it but somehow by the end of the game FromSoftware managed to make me feel annoyed to find another dragon. How they do that? It's not just the overworld though, to be honest I don't remember how much boss reuse their actually was but I vividly remember after Ranni's long ass quest that I had to read a guide for finding Astel was pretty cool (even if I didn't much enjoy the fight), so it was a little odd when I found a second one, just kind of wandering about... It just feels like they really overshot how big they could make their world and then ran out of money to fill it up with actual meaningful stuff.\nNext up is the story, I don't know why they needed fuckin George R.R. Martin for this because this is just Dark Souls again and honestly I'd have liked something a little more involved this time round. I replayed this game right after Silksong and I know that game doesn't have a perfect story, to be honest I'm not even sure I'd say it had a good story but I still enjoyed watching it and how I could interact with the world through Hornet. I feel like just a quest log would've been nice because half the time I don't even know if I'm doing a quest or what because it's so convoluted and esoteric and when I voice this complaint I get told to shut up and just use a guide?? A guide should not be so essential to experiencing all a game has to offer. Not to mention after finishing my first playthrough, listening to all the dialogue and never skipping a cutscene I still didn't feel like I quite understood the story. Like I got a general idea but I'd love if Miyazaki threw a bone to a layperson like myself.\nLast thing I gotta complain about is that the bosses are just worse... Like DS3 and Sekiro straight blow this game out of the water with their bosses both it highs and consistency. There are so many bosses in this game that I just thought what the fuck after beating them. So many of the attacks in this game are almost comically delayed and then there are some attacks like the little knife swing after the main attack by Margit (and Margott I guess) that I'm yet to intuitively figure out how to dodge them. I'm 100% sure there is a way to dodge them but I've never had this experience with a game where I just can't seem to figure out what I'm meant to do (other than just not attack in certain windows which is a bit boring) and it's a bit frustrating. Most boss fights are also plagued with the bosses sometimes just walking about instead of fighting you properly which really slows down the pace and I kind of felt like they fixed that problem in Sekiro so I have to assume it's intended but like why? The boss music (and music in general) of this game isn't all that great too I can't lie. Like it's passable I guess but it's no DS3 to be sure. Sekiro had a similar issue but in that game I was so focused on the bosses that I didn't really notice it as much. I feel like this problem is talked about too little too, maybe I just have bad ears or something but still. I don't want to completely disregard the bosses however because Elden Ring certainly has some bangers, I quite liked Godrick even if he was way kind of poorly balanced, being way easier than Margit for some reason. Commander Niall, Messmer, Romina and Bayle were all pretty great too however bosses like these were pretty few and far between. There are also bosses like Maliketh however that suffer from this game's fucked up balancing because it's so weird to me how he's so much more difficult than any other boss in the game and in my opinon the hardest souls boss I've ever fought except for maybe Midir, at least he was pretty engaging unlike Midir.\nElden Ring isn't a bad game but I feel like it's far too unfocused to be a good game. The world is too big and I don't think FromSoftware was really ready to create a game at such a large scale yet. If there was a third of the bosses, areas and items I feel like the remaining stuff could've gotten much more focus and I think a better game would've come out. I know I'm basically just asking for Dark Souls 4 but how can I not when the third entry remains the best game FromSoftware has made? I also heard Elden Ring consumed a Sekiro DLC and that breaks my heart but kind of makes sense as there's no shot Malenia wasn't meant to be a Sekiro boss at some point with that moveset. I did enjoy the game a lot more on playthroughs after my first because I didn't feel like I needed to fight bosses in the \"proper\" way so instead I could just opt for throwing random bullshit and that was more fun.\n5 -> 6, fuck me, I just played a magic playthrough and had a pretty good I time I don't know anymore."

    "description": "Yes, it's technically not its own standalone product, but I think considering I've spent more time on it than anything else, it deserves its own placement. Hypixel Skyblock is something I hold very near and dear; I've spent ~1500 hours playing it, and in that time I've both been mind-numbingly bored and had some of the best experiences I've ever had playing a game. This whole thing is probably going to be super incoherent, so just try to stick with me, please (not that I'm super coherent often).\nThe gameplay of Skyblock is uniquely addicting to me; the majority of it will be doing the same thing over and over, so it's not exactly super interesting, but sometimes being able to watch something while absent-mindedly clicking things and hearing that ringing sound of gaining EXP or the sound of many glass panes breaking at once when I was armadillo mining are things that have been seared into my memory permanently, for better or for worse. The more \"active\" parts of this game (dungeons, Kuudra, slayers, etc.) are slightly more engaged but just as grindy; however, I don't really see that as a bad thing. I've always seen these videos of people grinding for some super rare item drop in Runescape, and while I think Runescape is a great game (even after some of their recent rather shitty decisions), I've never been so invested that I've ended up grinding to get some of these extremely rare items as drops. In Skyblock, however, I was pretty all in, and that let me have three ultra-rare drops: firstly, the overflux capacitor and an epic dragon pet, neither of which I was grinding for, but both were pretty exciting moments regardless, but most importantly, my lovely giant sword. It's not even that good a sword (though I was grinding in a time before the claymore), and even with the rather mediocre mining setup I had at the time, I could've bought it in like five hours, but I grinded that motherfucker well over the drop rate, doing, I think, almost 1k F6s (I know that's pretty small compared to some Hyperion grinds, but F6 party finder parties are something else) before I got it, and when I finally dropped it, I was euphoric. I don't regret wasting my time like this for a second, and that's probably the best result for a game like Skyblock. I'm going to say here that the moment of excitement and joy I had there was probably the best moment of my entire life thus far. This isn't to say I've had some awful life or haven't had some experiences that almost everyone would consider more important and all around \"better\", yet that moment has stuck with me and is still enough to get a grin when I think of it. The Skyblock admins have also recently (like within the past two years) added some pretty exciting content too that really feels more gameplay focused, such as the rift and the slayer updates post-enderman slayer.\nThere are some issues I hold with some of the newer content, though. Skyblock, until a while ago, didn't really have any story and only had a few quests; however, now they've started adding a lot more quests and general story-based content. This isn't a bad thing in and of itself; I just don't think the approach they've taken to writing quests is all that good. Obviously I didn't expect a masterpiece story from this game, and I appreciate that they aren't taking themselves too seriously considering they're a gamemode in a server in Minecraft, but all the sarcasm and jokes seem way too on the nose to actually be funny. It seems like they've taken a sort of Runescape style in writing their quests, with lots of puns in the names of characters and them acting all silly and very video-gamey, but I find that Skyblock gets too heavy-handed with this, that they do it so often it loses some of the sincerity I found in the characters of Runescape. I was fine with it during most of the rift, but once I finally got around to trying out the foraging update and found out the CENTRAL NPC is named \"David Hunterborough\" it started to grate on me. It didn't help that much of the new foraging content has so many systems that are all taught to you back to back, not really giving much time to digest any of them. Mr Hunterborough didn't even have any witty dialogue; he just talked like any other NPC, so it's not like his dialogue-filled tutorial was even that engaging. I kind of liked the way previous content drops like the dungeons gave you a short rundown and then kind of just let you go to town and figure out the rest as you go, and most of the stuff, like essence and stars, was so intuitive that no tutorial was even needed. The mining update was a bit less so, but eventually I got the hang of it, the same with the new nether stuff, but I felt like the foraging update went a little too far, especially when instead of developing on previous systems (apart from adding one billion essences), which would've made the pretty disconnected feeling game feel like one homogeneous thing, yet the admins keep adding new, shallow systems. One way they expanded on a system was the pretty big revamp of the attributes system, and while I'd love to complain even more, I thought it was pretty cool.\nOne last titbit before I end this: I'm well aware Skyblock is full of P2W, but at the same time, I just don't care. It's not like I'm fighting these guys; if anything, more people with better gear is a good thing if I'm doing something like dungeons with them and opens more money options if I want to enderman carry them or something."

I'm not sure if that's just a problem with my PC but a game like Terraria should always be running a rock solid 60 FPS imho if Fortnite can do 144. Also this is 100% a wiki game, obviously whether that's a good thing depends on personal preference but had I not been told I doubt I'd ever have done something like summoning the WOF. Perhaps the Guide mentions something about it (I don't know why he would want to die though) or a voodoo doll could've fallen in the lava by accident but that's not a given. There are also mechanics like happiness and luck that while they don't matter all too much are still features and are hardly explained to the player (in luck's case I don't think they even try to explain it). I can definitely understand why people struggle to get into Terraria so I'd highly recommend playing it with a friend, it's how I got into it and both of us slowly figuring it out and watching guides are some of my fondest memories I've had gaming."

The fight is pretty good too but I just cannot read this with a straight face I just feel silly. \n Edit: I made a full review on MAL so I thought I'd just copy it over here, at least you guys don't have the ability to confused react my reviews. \n Has Boichi... seen a woman before? \n I actually enjoy most of Boichi's fight scenes. This is because Boichi usually sticks in his lane and has men fighting because men are what he's good at drawing. Boichi really falls off when he does anything with women; they weren't well written or well drawn in Sun-Ken Rock, and they sure as hell aren't here either. \n Boichi is seemingly completely perplexed by the female form and is physically capable of not drawing the most horny shit he can think of. Obviously, the actual One Piece isn't free from this either because Oda was the one who chose the outfits and the one who can't seem to stop himself from increasing the size of Nami's tits, but you know, anyone can wear whatever they want, and maybe Nami's boobs are just growing naturally (?? probably not though). Boichi though, is physically incapable of not doing a close up of their boobs or asses for a single second, and for some reason, Kalifa's clothes seem to be a lot tighter than the real fight. I wonder why. Also, Boichi draws women's eyes weird. \n The actual fight is pretty decent; I'd even say better than the One Piece fight because it actually feels like a fight, not a conversation broken up by yelling weird move names. If only Boichi focused more on that, instead of focusing on finding out how many crotch shots he can get from Khalifa shot. This is made exclusivly for horny teenagers and even then, why would you read this when there is no actual nudity? Deeply confusing read."

It had bad pacing like they said that Mori is changing after knowing him for like 2 weeks and it felt slow and fast at the same time somehow so I probably would have dropped this but apparently after volume 3 the original author left and the artist had to do his job for him, and the artist immediately killed off most of the side characters literally or by turning them into whores. He changed the plot from a sports manga to a psychological manga with climbing as a backdrop to it and the art kept getting better and better and by the final climb it had reached a peak as high as even Berserk and Vagabond in my opinion. The final climb was probably my favourite arc and ending in all of manga and hit so hard not knowing if he would live or die until the very end. I did not move for the entire duration of it. This is peak literally and figuratively (I'm a comedic genius). \n Edit: I went a bit hard on the start of the manga it's not that bad, not that good either though."

Prior to L dying it was top tier, past that point it goes to shit but it was just so good I can't rate it lower."

    "description": "Me when jokes are actually funny.\nEdit: 9 -> 8, I'm sorry my beloved but after Vampire Family's insanely good first season I've been forced to come to terms with how weak some sections of this Webtoon are. Obviously the jokes are top notch, probably the best to come out of a Webtoon but this whole story is really unbalanced. It's very clear the author didn't really have any plans going into it with how drasticly the tone shifts later on. Most of the first season is just gag comedy which is great but then it shifts pretty hard into a more drama-filled series in the following seasons. It just gives me the vibe the author was pretty unprepared to write an ongoing story."

    "description": "Jumbo don't deserve this disrespect! \n Edit: Are we deadass right now? \n I'm not quite the intended audience for this manga, I find slice of life horribly boring (too shounen brained as I've heard it put) and I despise children, but despite my better judgement I gave this manga a shot because of its absurdly high rating on MAL. After reading four volumes of this I think I can safely say Yotsuba is not for me. \n I might just be some sort of grinch who hates sunshine and joy, but Yotsuba just being happy and enjoying herself wasn't enough to keep me coming back, especially when the humor felt very one note and repetitive, she misunderstands something because she's a dumbass, overreacts and that's about it. Yotsuba being an stupid little kid who overreacts constantly might be realistic, kids are awful after all, but it never really feels like anything was changing. The cast grows but it feels like Yotsuba at the start would be identical to the Yotsuba at the end as she doesn't grown in any meaningful way physically or mentally. This felt a bit off to me as growing is really the only thing kids are good at. \n The aspects that keep this from being a not recommended for me are the side characters and art, I really enjoy the interactions between the supporting cast, it feels like a nice reprieve from the generally mind numbing content of this manga. The art too, while not stunningly beautiful like many of the manga it somehow manages to rank above on MAL (😡😡) is very charming and holds up a lot better than many of the other manga releasing during the same time period. Not just that, from what I've seen in the later chapters it's grown a fair bit (though Yotsuba does kind of look out of place sometimes, I mean look at this: https://i.imgur.com/xP6yTbt.png)."

The best aspect of this was the art, even if most character designs aren't super interesting the art for the MC and the monsters is always super cool to look at as well as the huge attacks. I just wish it had a little less edge, the MC cannot catch a break and while it felt alright for a three chapter series just to set it up, when every chapter or two it tells us how much pain he's in or introduces best friends we've never heard of just to kill them off, it feels like a bit much. Aside from the MC being tortured it's a pretty generic gate Manhwa so it gets boring fairly quickly especially when it collapses in on it self about 15 chapters in. I don't know if the author got told he could only make like 40 chapters or something but the pace becomes completely fucked and it gets extremely confusing with random retcons and shit going on. \n Edit 3: I might be going completely schizo so I won't update the score just yet but I think I see a very bizarre vision for this manhwa and I think maybe we're going somewhere.

It's a pretty unique twist on the murim genre, the concept of demigods getting urinary stones or syphilis and requiring doctors just like us isn't one I've seen before so it kept me well engaged. The art isn't my favourite, but it's unique (to its detriment in my opinion, but still). The MC isn't a huge dickhead which is nice, it's not some overblow OP MC slop either (though the MC is pretty powerful) and the dynamic between him and his master is very charming. It does seem to lose its way later on and the story becomes a little convuluted but I still thought it was fine."

The story while not some complex mindfuck is charming and just what it needs to be to facilitate the real draw of this manga, Musashi's character development from an immature strong man to an immaturish stronger man. Watching Musashi contemplate shit is extremely entertaining even if a lot of the Buddhist philosophy seems to right over my head. This manga also flows extremely well moving from chapter to chapter in a way that makes me unable to pull myself from it. All the side characters are super fleshed out and interesting even ones that disappear in just a few chapters. Some people might find backstories in backstories annoying but I don't really mind especially when everything is so well done. Its very unfortunate Vagabond will likely never finish, but I'm fine with rereading it over and over pretending that it'll come back one day. If you're fine starting a story that doesn't have a conclusion please give Vagabond a shot (I'm begging on my hands and knees)."

It looks pretty weird and the colours also just feel a little off, I'm unsure if that was a stylistic choice or just the way the artist likes to draw but it's a little bizarre regardless. The story was alright, I thought some moments felt like the author was pushing a little too far out of his capabilities but at least the author was trying which is something you can't say for a lot of manhwa.

The art is fuckin stunning, apparently there is a full team working on this and it shows, they hardly cut any corners especially with the awesome, massive fights. Moments where all the characters are just sitting around on the other hand often integrate the free assets you see often in other manhwas and while it stands out a little and I'd prefer it to not be with that way, I'll give them a pass as clearly the dialogue is more important than the art in such scenes. \n The actual story is good too even if it's sometimes a little repetitive, some arcs, especially those earlier are on aren't my favourite but it really picks up and almost every later arc is really enjoyable and the camaraderie between Cheongmyeong and his sect siblings is charming. There are even some tear jerker moments that feel heartfelt, really has anything you could ask for from a shounen manhwa."

Super cool manhwa, the artstyle is a unique mix of black and white (red, blue and purple too) in hell and coloured panels for the surface (it's cooler than it sounds, trust). The art also really compliments the big, sick ass fights too. Every character has a super unique design and fighting style, it's so cool. The comedy isn't much but it makes the manhwa better than if it didn't have it. The story too, while it feels a little frantic at the end is massively entertaining to watch play out, especially with a MC as charismatic as Jang."

    "description": "Me when something meant to be suspenseful is actually suspenseful!! Truly an impossible feat.\nEdit: Really kind of undersold it here, so I'll give Sweet Home a little more love. Sweet Home is probably the best thriller manhwa out there. I know it's primarily sold to people as a horror manhwa (at least as I've seen), but unfortunately, it's not really all that scary. I'm not trying to say I'm a super macho guy who doesn't get scared; it's just that I'm not sure if something in this format can be genuinely scary...\nAs for the thriller element, however, it does a really good job. The author was seemingly willing to kill off people, which made the scenes of hiding properly tense. It helped that every character except that fat girl (thank god she died) was pretty likeable; the MC's mental health journey going on simultaneously with the whole world-ending monster situation was really cool and pretty uplifting too. It felt like every character had their own thing going on, which helped me be worried about what was going on with them; if these were the usual cardboard cutouts you find in manhwas, this would've been quite a lot harder. The story itself is pretty unique too; manhwas sadly severely lack them, and having one this good brings a tear to my eye. The monsters are also pretty cool and unique, even if it feels a little like after a point the new designs stop standing out so much; I guess they were less of the focus by that point. The ending was a little corny, but it was also sweet (home??), made me tear up a little, to be honest."
