It was a little hard to watch Beth's life spiral into hell but I do hear that happening a lot with geniuses and it been rough to see was definitely intentional, didn't make it easy though. There were a few parts that felt a little sped through and I'd have probably liked this show more if it had maybe two seasons so they could properly flesh out some of Beth's life but idrc all that much and its not like Netflix to give a good show another season anyhow.

Like it has these silly montages but also has everything going to shit and it doesn't really do it for me but manages to pick it up in the second half. Snape's relationship with Harry's father is one of the most interesting things in the whole series in my opinion as it really fleshes him out as one of if not the most interesting characters in the whole series. Apart from that though this film felt weak especially coming off the back of the great Goblet of Fire, the dialogue felt more dry (aside from some standouts like Snape and Ron's brothers, like the way Fred delivers \"I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement\" is just so peak). I also really liked the line \"By which time I shall be gone and you shall be dead\", I don't know if it was purposefully funny but it gave me a chuckle, however Dumbledore and Voldemort's fight would've looked a hell of a lot cooler without all those quick cuts and shaky camera movements. For some reason the director (or the author I dunno I've never read Harry Potter sorry) seemed to be going more and more in on moody Harry Potter which wasn't a super interesting character to watch, along with that it just kind of pissed me off how wilfully ignorant the ministry of magic though it's kind of exactly what's happening right now IRL (though I doubt IRL they can just kill the people in charge like they did here). Don't really like Luna either, she's just weird man though I was also just having an shit day when I watched this so that might've factored into how I feel about this."

I like how this film was shot a hell of a lot more than the previous, felt a lot less gloomy and just more interesting to look at, I don't know if they bought new cameras or something but whatever they did, it's working, this is easily the best looking Harry Potter film so far. The CGI wasn't as bad either. I appreciated this film doing more to flesh out the world of Harry Potter, just there being different schools and having global sporting events helped break the monotony I was starting to feel after having watched three films in the same general area. Does have me wondering though, are there wizards in like China and America? There probably are if they had a Chinese dragon but surely they have a bunch of people strong enough to take out Voldemort, China has like 10x more people than Britain. I wasn't a huge fan of the Harry Potter has highschool drama plotline but it was decently realistic I guess (though the classic talking through other people kind of went out of fashion in year 6) and it was nice seeing Ron stand up for himself even if he was wrong in the end (my goat).

Something I did forget though is just how British this show is, it's kind of hard to forget just how funny the Brits are but there way of saying things is infinitely more funny than Americans for me, just the bus driver guy saying well come on then got a chuckle out of me, liked the Jamaican bus thingy too, best manic episode ever. I also liked Ron just being really confused the whole time, love that guy. Wasn't a huge fan of how this one was filmed compared with the other two, felt a little darker, less theatrical with more reliance on CGI and honestly it didn't really feel like it fit the mood a lot of the time, I especially found going from slapstick with Harry's aunt straight to running away from home and riding a bus full of crackheads to be especially jarring. The CGI is pretty bad too as well as some pretty awful greenscreened scenes. The tone of the film also seemed darker and it definitely felt like it was properly leaning in on being spooky, especially with that train scene which I actually enjoyed however it seemed a bit odd in comparison with the last couple of movies. Another jarring change was the soundtrack this time round which leaned a lot more big band than magical in scenes where it was trying to be all whimsical which I wasn't much a fan of either, came off tacky. Don't much like Hagrid trying to be all emotional either, just doesn't feel very real, nor do really any of the serious moments in this film either because they're undercut by a joke (though at least in this most of the jokes land) or just the actors don't really sell them. Snape gets too much disrespect in this film as well, realest mf out there and Harry makes fun of his nose."

The comedy in this seemed to be better too, it had a lot of slapstick which I'm not super fond of nor am I much fond of the opening sequence with Dobby ruining everything but from there I really enjoyed it. Ron's actor especially was popping off with those insane ass faces and the funniest moment was him calling his owl a bloody menace, it's not all that funny but I just didn't see it coming at all. I also liked the scene with Harry and Dobby in the infirmary, Dobby talking bout how he's treated like vermin and gets death threats five times a day was really unexpected and funny. The CGI is better in this too even if Dobby isn't super convincing. The moaning Myrtle section also lowkey spooked me when I saw it as a kid and that's probably the first time a film did that, pretty fond memory. Lots of stupid ass moments though, I was shaking and crying when Riddle rearranged his name and it was I am Lord Voldemort ðŸ˜­. Didn't remember Ginny having such a crucial part either but it does make them getting together later on make more sense to me, sidenote before watching this I Googled why they got together because I had forgotten and I found this insane ass article which seemed way too interested in 16 year old's fucking https://hp-essays.livejournal.com/132755.html.

This show has many, many of the funniest moments I've seen on TV but at the same time every great episode seems to be spaced out by a shit episode. The whole show is walking a very tight line between being painful to watch and hilarious and honestly many of the episodes, especially those in the first few seasons were just so dry of anything remotely funny. Honestly the entire first season was a shit show, it was way too meanspirited which I don't have a problem with implicitly, I mean the implication scene was super funny and that was dark as shit but I only found it to be funny because it was felt like it was leaning into being silly with Mac's interruptions and Dennis yelling at that old lady. Some of the episodes near the start though were just the gang being evil assholes without enough pushback coming their way imo. Didn't help that Dee hadn't really transformed into the batshit insane version of herself that she is now so she was infinitely less interesting and funny than she is now.\nAfter Frank's breakdown was really when the show started to pick up for me, the whole group dynamic was almost in the place it is now so I felt like jokes just kind of played better with the chemistry between the gang. These days the show is dragging a bit for me though any show would after 16 seasons, it's clearly becoming increasingly more difficult for the writers to think up ways to change the formula they've been using for almost two decades but somehow they still plan on having two more seasons which I'm a little worried about to be honest (though some of the COVID era episodes were great so maybe it won't be two terrible). I can appreciate though how there are some more real moments in the later seasons too, Mac being gay now honestly came off really well to me at least and didn't feel as performative as some other shows I've seen do things relating to politically relevant topics (looking at you Brooklyn 99). I don't care what stupid people on Reddit say you can't make me hate this moment, it was pretentious and bizarre and out of character and it was a beautiful fuckin moment of television fuck all of yall some of you guys don't have emotions. I'd have been pissed off if that scene got played for laughs and later on him coming out over and over does get played for laughs so everyone gets what they want, it's pissing me off thinking about how this episode pissed people off. I also really like the scene of Charlie breaking down about his dad in season 15, it was a performance I hadn't expected from this show but it was passionate and just a really strong showing from the actor playing him so I didn't even mind it being over the top dramatic with the pouring rain and bagpipes. If you had just shown me the first season I'd never have expected such a moment, even manages to be funny too. Truly the show of all time, best watched in the form of compilations on Youtube."

The performances are really what sell this one for me, it's over the top in the same way that plays are, which I'm unsure if it was intentional but it helped the film stand out. A lot of the characters are pretty iconic and their lines, while not sounding all that much like something a real person would say, do seem like something that'd be written in a book so yk it just works. Along with that this film has some really fuckin funny moments, that scene where Albino is talking all evil like before clearing his throat and being British was eye-wateringly funny.\nWhat didn't age well was about everything that the actors didn't have control over. The film looks good some of the time but then also just looks shit sometimes too, I don't know how much this had to do with camera limitations of the time but that doesn't change it looking bad. The transitions between scenes and especially the shitty dubbing when the characters are far away or walking down hills or whatever really take me out of the movie. I don't think there's ever been a scene that makes me as aware that I'm watching a film as the one where Westley and the princess roll down the hill with shitty voiceover ouch sounds. Genuinely terrible scene that nearly destroyed the film for me. Also wasn't a huge fan of the little cutaways to the kid and dad reading the book, despite it probably not being cliche at the time (I assume), it feels overdone now and it's been done a lot better (the Lego Movie's use of it for example). The old guy telling the kid to shut up was funny though.\nI know I've been lowkey bashing the film more than I've been praising it but it really was a fun watch and while it's not as timeless as people seem to think (imho ofc) it's still worth your time and I cannot overstate just how funny some of the moments in this are."

I appreciate that they put in some character development for Tony, with him going from snarky jackass to a little less snarky jackass, so much like me fr. The CGI (or practically effects, whatever they had going on) held up reasonably well too, it had some bad moments, that scene with Tony was being chased by the two fighter jets especially, but generally when Tony was inside the suit it looked pretty good, the sound design was pretty nice too. I'll have some trouble forgiving the slide transition though, PowerPoint shit.\nWhile I forgave unrealistic moments earlier I'd have still have really loved if they gave Tony a better villain. In theory the Obadiah seems decent, evil business partner, he has motives and means, they even have a reveal where it's like oooo he was bad the whole time!!

The only one not willing to kill the little girl is only doing it because she's scared of the political blowback so even if you feel as if the right call is not killing the girl you really don't have anyone to be rooting for or to identify with.\nAnother problem I have is that while drone combat was and still is very topical (I mean just a few hours ago as of writing this Ukraine blew up 34% of Russian bombers or something insane like that with drones), it's just very uninteresting for me to watch that kind of combat in movie form. In movies there's already that separation between them and reality so the pressure of a combat scene is lessened unless it's really well done, as you know there is no inherent danger to the actor. But in this film there's even more separation, the only good guys truly in danger were the little girl and that guy operating the little bug drone, and while I admit I did feel nervous watching the bug drone pilot piloting it out in open, by the time the girl was properly in danger the stakes had become so high that I really didn't care if she survived or not.\nThis isn't even mentioning that every character was shockingly undeveloped, I didn't know anything about anyone except for knowing Powell is an obsessive freak, Jesse Pinkman and that lady seem painfully ill prepared for their job and that one British white lady is annoying. This makes it really hard to care about anyone, especially the little girl who really has no personality at all, I don't know why the director bothered showing scenes of her reading and hula hooping n shit if they weren't going to build her as a real character.

The scene with Charlotte walking through the headquarters with that Motion Picture Soundtrack cover playing was so cool and tense it made me forgive every bad thing I thought about season one though.

Inglorious Bastards is shot beautifully from setting to cinematography and definitely gets the most out of its 2009 cameras, I can hardly believe Final Destination was released the same year, it's impressive just how well Inglorious Bastards has held up in comparison.\nThe first scene of this movie is so fuckin good, the tension it builds and then holds for almost twenty minutes has me tingling, it has me gulping and shit. The way the camera moves down to reveal the Jews, the way that Landa and Perrier stare at each other is so great and the way the music builds until it's practically blasting out your eardrums is just so peak.

I also really like how in some scene when you're viewing from the point of view of a character who doesn't know a language, the conversation isn't subtitled, I know this isn't an uncommon thing to do but it makes me feel more connected with the characters by being just as confused as they are.\nI'd talk more about this film but I fear I'd spoil it like I was. I'm stupid and checked the wiki to figure out names mid-film, accidentally reading what happens to Zoller in the end while I was still only on the 3rd chapter in the process.

Landa is such a good character dude it's insane, Waltz absolutely deserved that Oscar, he really made the character and carried the scenes he was in.

However, I sat with it for a day or two and realised this was a good fuckin film, though I felt the cast of characters weren't exactly as funny and charismatic together as Jules and Vincent, I still didn't have a single character I disliked (except for maybe Mr. Blonde but him being an evil dickhead was on purpose and he got what was coming to him in the end which was nice. Sidenote, he looks scarily similar to the guy who plays Rigsby in The Mentalist, it's crazy.) There's a lot of real funny moments in this film too especially when it's just them fucking around and having a good time, you really feel like you get to know the characters in moments like that along with the brilliant introductions which a few of them get. My favourite has got to be Mr Orange's, Tim Roth acts his ass off and the whole learning and telling the story with it coming to life as he gets into character is so simple but such an awesome scene. \n My only proper issue is don't like how much torture and people bleeding out and dying goes on in this, it's just so hard to watch and I'm sure that was the point but that doesn't make it easier to see. Maybe I'm going through male menopause I dunno, I know the Pulp Fiction rape dungeon scene is a bit similar but it didn't feel as brutal as when Mr Blonde was torturing that cop or when Mr Orange was bleeding out and crying in pain and shit.

    "description": "A lot more wacky than you'd expect for a film with such a grim premise, the dialogue is often comically over the top. The characters seem to inhabit a Pulp Fiction-esque world where police both do and don't exist in some state of quantum superposition making it completely possible to shoot out a window in the middle of New York and get away while also having hundreds of people storm your house after an hour or so of search for you. For some reason though, instead of going with fun over the top, the movie decided to go with depressing and uncomfortable which made the over-the-topness come off more corny than funny. \nThe girl did pretty well especially considering how young the actor seemed though, but by no fault of hers the script seems to be on some fucked up anti Madoka Magica shit where instead of a 14 year old acting like a 5 year old this 12 year old acts old and jaded as shit. Maybe I was just a stupid ass 12 year old or something but Matilda seems way to into smoking and wanting to kill herself for a 12 year old even if she's had a fucked life and its a little jarring. \n The weird 12 year old having a crush on her old ass father figure was fucked too and didn't help the movies situation making it infinitely more uncomfortable to watch. I'm sure they were going for something with Matilda being a kid and having confusing emotions n shit but it was weird and deeply disturbing which are both things I don't go out in search for. The music was quite nice at least, I was a bit surprised by the inclusion of Bjork, forgot she was popular for a while."

I'm unsure as to why they decided to make family drama and shit acting as if this was an actual movie, this was just a funny stupid film and it should've stayed as such. I thought it was a little too self referential as well, it didn't really feel like I was watching a Minecraft movie, more just a stupid ass block film with guys yelling Minecraft words if you get me, though I should've expected it based on the trailers. \nThe live action actors look terribly out of place but I think their actual acting was pretty well done aside from the autistic kids sister having a few bad line deliveries that stood out and the black woman being just a stereotypical movie black woman who yells. Seeing my country in the movie was cool too despite them picking the backwater shithole that is Huntley."

Tragically I ended up never liking the characters (except for Javi and Sammy because they just little guys) and when you root against the people it kind of ruins the show, also it was labelled as horror but it really wasn't that horror-y? Fire ass cover image though.\nEdit: 3 -> 4, I decided to give this another shot, I actually got through it this time but I did have to skip a lot and use the wiki to figure out what I missed because holy shit I hate Natalie so much. She is absolutely the worst and I can't fathom why anyone puts up with her. The rest of it was alright, I dunno, I enjoyed seeing the kids in the woods a lot more than them out about in the future which are scenes I can generally only sit through because Misty is an interesting curveball. Callie is a pretty cool character too, nice to see the actor made a comeback after being in the worst thing ever Impulsive, love her interactions with Jeff. Just gotta say though, that one jumpscare in season two with that Christian girl looked stupid as shit. The Climbing Up The Walls scene in the same episode made up for it though."

BoJack horseman handles dark issues like substance abuse and BoJack's trauma of his terrible childhood in a very real way making BoJack seem like more of a person then most characters in other shows and hes not ever a person. Also it has Aaron Paul as todd whats not to love."

Fantastic Mr. Fox is a jaw-droppingly beautiful film with its stop motion and unique aesthetic which make it something I doubt we'll ever see again. The way you can almost feel the amount of effort put into every frame makes watching this film worthwhile to check out. Aside from that though the story, while rather simple is very human despite the characters being foxes. That scene where Mr Fox talks about not wanting to live in a hole anymore, aside from just being a brilliantly shot scene with that single viewpoint of Mr Fox reading the paper, really made me really feel for Mr Fox. His concerns felt very real and considering animals in the film live their proper animal lifespans I can understand his urgency, that detail also makes it make sense why everyone's darting around and shit aside from it being funny to watch and making stop motion easier. These guys are going to live for like seven years, got to make the most out of it (even if it ends up fucking everything up and making Mr Fox come to the realisation that he is quite a lot more domesticated than he thought). Love this film."

Last season was kind of a step down but still a great show, rip Andre Braugher.\nEdit: Just rewatched this show and I think I might have some more to say (not that I really said anything at all last time). First off, this show was funny when I first saw it at 13 and remains funny now. I also think it actually peaks pretty late on in season four or maybe even season five. I mean that moment when Holt says he should've fired Terry in season five's Halloween episode remains one of the funniest moments in any show I've ever seen. The characters are pretty interesting too, they learn things and they change across the show, not much mind you but it's a sitcom so anything at all is nice to see. I've seen the show take the most shit for it being \"woke\" which I totally agree with but I feel like for the majority of the show, while it mightn't have been all that subtle, it at least still felt sincere and pretty funny too when worked into jokes like when the warden talks about how trans people are treated in prison with Jake. Shits funny and relevant, it's awesome. But in the last season it starts to feel more forced, like the first episode of season eight was so bad I fully stopped watching the show after it despite it being my favourite show of all time at that time. This might also just be my dislike for Rosa talking when I say this though as it was a pretty Rosa-centric. Also I've just gotta say, Rosa is such a terrible character, she has nearly no actually interesting elements about her despite the writers trying so hard to make it work over and over. She feels like a walking stereotype but unlike Scully for example who is also basically a character trope as a person, she keeps getting played serious during important scenes. It has never once felt right to me though because of how she's been basically boxed in as a character who doesn't express all that many emotions apart from anger and annoyance. Last episode almost made me cry though so don't listen to anything bad I said."

I did really enjoy the first few episodes though.\nEdit: Not as bad as I let own but still overrated as shit everyone such a whiny asshole. Some very cool ideas were going on though.\nEdit 2: 6.5 -> 3, Nah actually I lied to you. I tried to rewatch this shit and this is so fucking corny holy shit I was dying. The sub isn't less cringy it's just harder to judge cringe when you're reading it as opposed to hearing it.\nEdit: 3 -> 8, I think stockholm kicked in or something but I pushed through the corn and it led me to realise Attack on Titan really is something special. I can't really explain it but AOT is strangely captivating to me even if it took me a while to 'get' it.\nEdit 4: Ok I just rewatched it once more and I gotta rattle off some things, not changing the score at this point because honestly it's still probably an eight, just gotta complain. First off I just gotta say I wish Eren was a more likeable character, he felt like a whiny piece of shit the whole time and his change to being actually deplorable would've worked a lot better if I had liked him in the first place. I've seen some people compare his transformation to Walter's in Breaking Bad but the difference for me is that I actually liked Walter so it had an impact when everything started going downhill, here I was just happy to see him fail. Secondly there are so many moments that just had me confused, Armin surviving the massive fall after being burnt to a crisp, Reiner being able to transfer his consciousness, Eren not reverting Zeke's pure titans instantly despite telling Connie he'd revert his mum, Eren being able to use the founders power to attack Reiner despite not touching any titan of royal blood, people from Paradis not having different accents to Marleyans and Eren not starting the rumbling in Marley, these are just off the dome too. I'm sure some of these have explanations but when I've Googled them it didn't get cleared up at all. For Eren not reverting the pure titans the most feasible explanation was that he just forgot because clearly Zeke's spinal fluid didn't stop him as he could save Connie's mum. Eren being able to use founding powers while not touching a titan of royal blood was explained by some guy saying that founding powers are like a battery and he just had a little bit of charge left to kill of Reiner with which seems like bullshit to me as the moment Zeke died the rumbling stopped. Rest of them just feel like bullshit with no explanation so I won't even bother. I'm not angry about weird things happening in a fantasy story, I'm angry about them being inconsistent. Last thing I gotta rattle off is I'm so pissed off that people shit on MAPPA's work for the last part of AOT, even with the CGI it looked way better than all the previous seasons, it's like people are forgetting the terrible riding scenes with the clearly 2D trees."

    "description": "Some guy named Kenzo is getting paid 5 yen per 19 hour shift for animating this shit, what a hero. \n Edit: 8.5 -> 7.5 Just watched season 2 and I gotta say some things, before going into it I was told how good the animation was over and over but to be honest I thought it was pretty jank a lot of the time and in general thought season one was better in that aspect, a lot of the time the perspective seemed off which caused the movement to seem weirdly uneven, not at all natural to me. It was clear far too much focus had been placed on the fight scenes and everything else was on the back burner. I also felt that many scenes were suffering from overuse of that blur affect, maybe it was to save time or something but it just looked dreadful, not to mention the random darkness which I heard was forced by the Japanese government for epilepsy or something so I really shouldn't complain about it but I don't care, it ruined multiple fight scenes for me in just how jarring it was, really took me out of it. The second fight between Gojo and Toji was cool though, felt like the extra stylised approach they went with really paid off, I also really liked the fight with Gojo in the train station, the jazzy ass infinite void sequence was so peak. The Sukuna vs Volcano guy was pretty sick as well along with the fight between Toji and Megumi, the ending was pretty sweet too, these cool moments don't cancel out just how weak the non fighting moments are generally. Sukuna vs Mahoraga however was honestly exhausting to watch, it went on for so long and followed so many other long and intense fights that it was hard to focus on no matter how \"good\" the animation was (though to be honest personally I found it hard to follow, it was perhaps over animated). The story was about on par with season one, maybe a little less streamlined. I also might just be remembering wrong but I don't remember season one having a narrator and the narrator this time round was absolutely terrible, I mean the guy himself did a fine job but just the whole idea of a narrator giving out random exposition was a bad one. The Mei Mei grooming scene put a bad taste in my mouth too. Sorry this whole edit was so disjointed, I've been writing it as I watch and can't really be bothered patching it up."

The plot is so complicated and convoluted with a mystery that is impossible to understand without seeing other Evangelion media and forgive me for wanting a series to be able to be digested without going through other movies just to get an understanding of a mystery that should have been answered at the start. No characters ever die, and if they do they are alive in the next episode so I am never worried.
