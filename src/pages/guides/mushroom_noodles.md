I'm no chef, so if you're reading this for a good recipe click off now. This is just for me because I've fucked this easy ass dish up twice now because I keep forgetting to half the ingredients in the recipe I read.

## Ingredients:

- [ ] 225g of udon noodles

- [ ] ½ a tsp of black pepper

- [ ] 4 decently sized mushrooms

- [ ] 2 decently sized garlic cloves

- [ ] Vegetable oil or rice bran oil

- [ ] ½ a tbsp of both dark and light soy sauces

- [ ] Spring onions, sesame seeds, egg (if you're feeling fancy)

## Instructions

Cut up the mushrooms decently thinly (like 8 slices a mushroom or so), then grind up your garlic. Put all the sliced mushroom into a non-stick pan with oil, and sauté until its a little brown but not too brown or you fucked up. It should take around 8 minutes. Once it's reached that point throw the garlic in and keep it in there at a low temp until it smells strongly and the mushrooms are a nice brown.

Boil some water and then AFTER boiled put your noodles in, don't let them get too soft though (unless you're a freak like that) so you'll need to take them out pretty quickly. During this time would probably be a good point to fry up an egg if you're going to.

Mix your noodles, mushrooms and garlic together with ½ a tbsp of dark soy sauce, light soy sauce and black pepper. After mixed put on spring onions, sesame seeds and an egg if you want.
