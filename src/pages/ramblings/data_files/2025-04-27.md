510 line long stylesheet -> 342 line long stylesheet. this must be how elon feels putting all those government employees on the streets.

decided to split my styles.css up, little guide for future me:

if its only used in one place, put it in the page itself

if its used in multiple places leave it in the stylesheet

if its used only in one place BUT has a related media query all deals are off and it says inside the styles.css

with this change i also removed the max-width: 50% thing in the panels, originally it was by mistake but i think i like it more this way as they should really be as big as possible always
