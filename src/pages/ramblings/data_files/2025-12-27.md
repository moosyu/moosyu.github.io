i made the patty and the chips, the chips were actually really good and crispy. i tried making some like mushroom fo-meat for the patty because i fw mushrooms heavy and frankly id have just liked if the patty tasted like mushrooms but it kind of just tasted like nothing which was a bit disappointing. maybe i shouldve put some extra mushroom in the burger or something. also i swear it didnt look as sad irl my camera just washes images out and the angle wasnt very good either but there were pickles, tomato, lettuce, avacado and cheese in there. id considered a fried egg but after spending multiple hours making a patty that didnt break into nothing the moment it was touched i really couldnt stomach the idea of going back into the kitchen.

i started watching volume 2 of stranger things season 5 (the first episode as of writing this) and while i was a little worried at the start because everything kind of felt like they were just saying it for the trailer, after a while things started happening and i think we're back on track. steve and dustin really need to make up though, fortunately in tv the beating the shit out of each other step is right before you start being best friends again. delightful derek always makes me smile, hope that kid ends up succeeding after stranger things.
