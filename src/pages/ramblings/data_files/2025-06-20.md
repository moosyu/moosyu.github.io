Little tutorial for taking screenshots on the Webtoon app:

What you'll need: A phone that you can download APKs onto and a PC with Windows on it (Linux works too probably but it might be a little more fiddly)

Download and install [Xposed-Disable-FLAG_SECURE](https://github.com/VarunS2002/Xposed-Disable-FLAG_SECURE), [LSPatch](https://github.com/JingMatrix/LSPatch/tree/v0.7) and [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/). Then turn developer mode on by tapping build number of OS version a bunch of times in your about phone section in your settings. Then go to developer settings in your settings, scroll too the debugging panel and enable USB debugging and if you're using a fuckass Redmi like me turn on Install via USB and USB debugging (Security settings). Restart your phone afterwards just in case, while it's doing that download [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) on your computer, you won't be using it but it comes along with adb and it's the only man I can trust. Plug your phone into your computer, open the scrcpy folder on your computer, open a terminal window and run the command:

```bash
adb devices
```

If it returns something then you're doing well, if not, terrible job and make sure to double check you've enabled USB debugging. If something did come up run this:

```bash
adb shell sh /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/moe.shizuku.privileged.api/start.sh
```

If all goes well you should get info: shizuku_starter exit with 0. From here go into your phone and open the shizuku app, it should say shizuku is running up the top, if it's telling you that you need to take an extra step then do what it says. Then go into manage authorized apps and enable LSPatch. Then go into LSPatch, if it says Shizuku service is not connected then just reload LSPatch and it should fix itself. As long as it says Shizuku service available you can go into the manage panel (the squares icon) and tap modules. In here enable the Disable-FLAG_SECURE module you downloaded earlier, then switch over to the apps section of module, press the plus and create a new folder then select it. Then for the new patch select an installed app, pick Webtoon, make the patch integrated and tap embed modules, tap select an installed app and pick Disable-FLAG-SECURE. Then start the patch. After the patch is done your Webtoon app should hopefully stop being an annoying piece of shit and let you take screenshot of what you paid for.
