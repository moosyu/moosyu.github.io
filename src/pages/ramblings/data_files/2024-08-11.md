i keep seeing a sick site and wanting to completely overhaul mine to look like theirs because it looks "too generic". idk if thats the case, the main layout of most things has stayed the same since ~2021 when i used a w3school tutorial to get it done so i suppose it could look generic but i think its fermented enough to have formed its own kind of identity?? idk, i keep feeling like the navbar isnt bullshit enough but in the same vein the top of the screen horizontal navbar has been adopted everywhere for a reason i guess. though i cant lie i feel a little jealous when i see melps' or incessantpain's cool ass navigation menus.
