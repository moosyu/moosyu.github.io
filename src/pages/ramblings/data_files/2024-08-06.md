im so fucking sick of needing to sign up to every website. like this is why i need 2fa on everything because passwords dont matter anymore because if i want to do anything at all i gotta sign up, wanna crop this image online? sign up!! want to view this document? sign up!! want to scan an image for ai? sign up!! so now, every password i have gets breached twice a week because they useless fucking sites have no idea how to safely store information. greatest ad for password managers ive ever seen. fuck you isitai.com, ill start scanning shit with my eyes from here on out.
