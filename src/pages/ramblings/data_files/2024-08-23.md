we did some arduino things in IT. it was pretty fun and i could actually talk to the lads instead of complete silence like always for some reason. idk why it became a youtube short i guess thats just what phone videos become these days.

i knew me being richard stallmans biggest opp had a purpose [(i grabbed these from a tweet by @jbenton)](https://x.com/jbenton/status/1172662964782075905) i highly doubt hes doing this to protect the kids like hes trying to frame it as in the second tweet. hes just a freaky ass mf whos spent far too long in the basement fermenting who doesnt have any kids himself and hasnt been a kid in like 200 years so cant possibly understand parents concerns of not wanting their kids to get legally groomed by some grimy ass mfs that look like him.
