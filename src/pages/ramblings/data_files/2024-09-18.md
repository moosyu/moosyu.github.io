alr i got rss dates working and i even made it so you can click things in the search and go directly to where they are in the reviews page. id like to optomise my site at some point soon becuase i dont think i should be bordering on 1 second build times. <span style="color: grey">[11ty]</span> <span style="color: #23cd61">Copied 199 Wrote 33 files in 0.95 seconds (v3.0.0-alpha.20)</span> (obv i use --incremental when testing but like still its kind of sad to see).
