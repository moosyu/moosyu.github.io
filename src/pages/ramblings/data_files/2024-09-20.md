focusing on studying is so hard its crazy. i really am trying but its rough man. unrelated some guy on discord told me my site is too big and personal sites should try to be under 1mb or some stupid shit. idk who he thinks he is but how you gonna try to make me restrict myself to what i want to do on my own website ?? next update is going to inlude the entirety of fortnite and its gonna take 5 hours to download my site.

i got rid of the js code for the neko-tag webring like i did for the rest of them and just replacing it with redirect urls. why did i not do that until now? idk i forgot. anyways that means the only bit of js that i dont control that is being exectuted on my site is from status.cafe which isnt too bad. still, id like to at some point (probably not soon) make my own selfhosted version of it. iirc piclog has its source public so i assume status.cafe does too but even if it doesnt surely it cant take too long if i dont need to worry about creating sign ups or anything if its just for me ??
