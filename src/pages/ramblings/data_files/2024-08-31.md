i wanted to join the bucket webring but i read the about page and it said no "hateful content" is allowed. while that is a pretty vague rule i think it would be a bit of a reach to say that my site has no hateful content on it, half my ramblings are just spreading hate online. still gonna give it a shot and pray ig becuase im just gonna assume they mean hate speech and i dont think i got any of that?? im not an ist or a bic of any kind.
