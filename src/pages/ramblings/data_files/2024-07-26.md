forgot to ramble in a month too busy eating ass and sucking toes sorry. also why do so many of these geocity clone sites have manifestos, they must wanna be the unibomber so bad. its fine but like im evil and hate everything so when i see 500 people write the same fucking 10 page long manifesto am i meant to not be a dick?? these are the hard hitting questions. anyone whos using neocities or alternatives (nekoweb and such) already know that the internet has become a shithole digital version of times square but with isis executions instead of homeless people pissing on the sidewalk. screaming into an endless circle jerk isnt gonna actually change anything. this isnt to say that i know the real answer to the modern internet being "bad" because there really isnt an answer. as the internet became not something just for nerds, websites that were more simplified and easier for the average person to use naturally became the most popular, and once youre the most popular and have as little competition as many websites you can just do whatever the fuck you want. so unless youre elon level wealthy you guys are really not gonna be able to do shit about it.
