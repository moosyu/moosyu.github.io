i have come to the tragic realisation that my website is hardly like old geocities sites anymore, and kind of from the start. when i first built it i just though "geocities sites look like shit so im just gonna make my site hurt your eyes". that was a pretty surface level look at geocities and considering that was the base of my site i cant really do much about it. i dont think my site is dense enough and as full of as much stuff around every corner like geocities sites. its very uninspired. the javascript amalgamations i have going on probably dont help either. i guess we'll see where this train of thought leads me some other time because i also dont want to just become an imitation. i think maybe its about just adding whatever i want and worrying about if it blows up pcs or fits on mobile screens later.
