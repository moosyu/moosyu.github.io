super excited for the real steve harrington to drop crux, been listening to basic being basic on repeat. that an jane removers albums are my most anticipated right now. also pretty curious to see how the new weatherday album will be, i've never listened to their music before but the cover stands out to me, same situation with japanese breakfast and squid.
