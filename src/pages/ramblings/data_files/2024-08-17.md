considering switching image hosts from imgur. id like to self host but i dont have a server and i dont wanna bloat the github project with too many images. i dont really trust imgur not to delete my shits but like im not gonna use catbox i know they say "heat death of universe" on their site but that is probably closer to like 5 years and it doesnt even work in australia.
