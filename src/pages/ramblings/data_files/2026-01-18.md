i made scones. sorry the picture is like a quarter of a scone i forgot to take a picture before everyone stole them. theyre cheese scones but i forgot i was making cheese scones until halfway thorough and just made normal ones so i added butter when i wasnt meant to but they seemed to turn out fine.
