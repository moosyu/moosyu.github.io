i made something that would go through my thoughts.json and put in dateModified bits for each entry based on the blame but like 99% of them ended up with the 25th of novemeber and i deadass spent an hour trying to bug fix before realising that that's when i made all of my data files into a single one. im go dumb... also i thought this commit message was really funny but rereading it that's not really the case...
