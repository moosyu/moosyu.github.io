as you may know (or probably dont) gemini is an alternative to http and its the most stupid piece of shit ive ever heard of. its not like you can build a minial text site on http and and sorry to say but if youre making a site on gemini youre wasting your time because nobody uses it. nobody is ever gonna read your gemini site which is probably a mirror to an http site anyway. same goes with gopher but its even more stifling then gemini. it just feels like a regression and the only people who use it are the same people who refuse to use js on their sites because they are mad that js can let people make trackers, like i dont like trackers but that was just the natural progression, deal with it mf. im aware this will come off very ranting (because it is) but ive had enough of these mental outlaw type guys pretending they living off the grid then hopping on their unmodified androids, straight onto instagram. dont go halfway.
