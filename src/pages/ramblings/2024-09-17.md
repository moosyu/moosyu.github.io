if im being real idk what else to add to my site, i feel like its reached its perfect form at least for its purposes (except eleventy-img intergration but im waiting for stable 3.0 release for that and i need to figure out how to get rss dates working at some point idk). maybe ill think of something else but for now updates gonna probably slow down a bunch. i also deleted the panels page because like really that should just be a folder.
