i mightve made the worst noodles of all time today, the mushroom ones i made a few days ago were way better. they looked a nicer brown in real life my phones camera is just awful but the taste was pretty awful. this was partly because i forgot to add shallot and eyeballed the amount of ingredients, also i didnt have enough noodles so i added 3/4 of every ingredient (except for vinegar and sugar because i forgot) but even then after only adding 3/4 of a tbsp of grated ginger this entire thing tasted so overwhelmingly of ginger it was insane. i added a tbsp of chilli sauce and a little more than 5 tbsps of chilli flakes but somehow this shit still managed to not be spicy and just be gingery. i dont know how this happened.

ok its been a few hours since i ate it and i got told my breath smells really good so maybe its just a really tedious alternative to gum
