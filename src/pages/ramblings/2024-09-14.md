stole some code for minifying the css and html. i was gonna use the 11ty image package to optimise the images but i think ill wait for 3 to come out as it looks like its getting a big upgrade and its not that important right now i think. <--- nevermind i just decided to bite the bullet and upgrade <---- never nevermind the image plugin isnt working with imgur so i give up for now
