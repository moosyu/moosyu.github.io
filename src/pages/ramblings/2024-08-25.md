its crazy that theres no real mal alternative for western comics. the only "good" choice is goodreads and goodreads sucks ass. everything on there is rated 4 and some of the ratings are fucking insane. you mean to tell me solo leveling is rated higher then dorohedoro, berserk and vagabond? piss off. and its not even like i think the mal scores are particularly good either, solo leveling is bordering dorohedoro on there but its just goodreads is so consistent in being shit, probably because 1 - 5 stars is such a trash way to rate things, they should at least have half stars. i also dont like rating in volumes, just let me rate a whole manga at once god damn, id prefer an overall rating and then an option to rate singular volumes, like how on aoty you rate the whole album then you get to rate songs if you want.
