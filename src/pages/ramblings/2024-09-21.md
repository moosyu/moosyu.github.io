since every ad i get is an ai chatbot ad i decided to try one out, but holy shit every ai chatbot is just porn. i wanted to do some like fake dungeons and dragons or something but the closest i could get was "Medieval Fantasy World RP" which kind of sucked ass. dialogue kept getting randomly cut off and ai still seems to be senile because sometimes i just seemed to not listen to what i wanted and continue anyways. i also really need prompts for there rpg chatbots, like dude i have no idea where to go at least give me something. after that i tried the hogwarts one and that was even worse, istg i had to keep google open for the entire time to search up who these guys are, i only know like 5 characters who the fuck is pansy parkinson <---- nevermind i need to edit this immediately, me and the rest of slitheryn just beat the shit out of harry this is peak fiction. anyways for now i cannot imagine ai stealing my job just yet. i also have to wonder if all this porn is getting moderated (i used janitorai because that was the first result on google for "best ai chatbot reddit 2024") but like 20% of the characters on here look like kids, maybe do something about that. there was also an unexpected amount of male characters (like double the amount of females) which came out of nowhere.
