After listening to FLY ENOUGH TO BE VIRGIL I was pretty excited and I think this met my expectations. I hope gets more attention because 15 ratings just makes me sad. My main issue with this though is that it seems to be a little all over the place but I imagine the new Tyler album is gonna be all over the place too and I'm gonna meatride that like crazy so this could grow on me. A lot of songs also just feel like nothing, like this would have been a much better 40 minute album. My favourite songs were SPOTLIGHTS and FLY ENOUGH TO BE VIRGIL.
