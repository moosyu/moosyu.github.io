Not on the same level as the previous part but Jojolion still has intriguing story and an interesting mystery even if the villain isn't very good especially when you compare him to valentine. On a sidenote no matter how much Ariki tries to pretend the Jojo's are straight they are clearly all raging homosexuals, Jousuke got a boner when he looked behind Yasuho and saw Joushu I'm telling you.
