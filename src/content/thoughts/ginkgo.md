Wasn't going to listen to this one to be honest but I got hounded into it. Terrible cover aside this was an alright album, I was a bit scared after having really not enjoyed D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L to be honest (though I don't really remember why) but I was kept reasonably entertained. A lot of this just made me want to listen to better albums though, lots of the songs (especially Chapel of Salt) felt a lot like Radiohead though I haven't really listened to much Britpop so there's probably a clearer comparison. None of this really blew me away or kept me super stimulated though it might just be that my dopamine receptors being blown out by Jane earlier, the album did seem to pick up after the first couple of songs though. The billy woods feature was nice though, I thought his voice and delivery really complimented the wacky instrumental and Honeycomb really brought back the energy which was maintained after the false start that was the first two songs.
