Brain tumor music. I don't think I can see colours anymore after watching that music video either. Aside from the loss of 10 years of my life this is just some pretty generic sounding modern breakcore, or maybe digital hardcore idk but its surely not hardcore sounding enough and if I'm being honest at this point all the breakcore I hear this days forms some kind of homogeneous glob in my head and asking me to name a single song would be quite a challenge. It bores me to death and every song sounds like bright colours and autism.
