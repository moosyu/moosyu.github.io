In anticipation for the new Squid album I decided to give this a listen and I thought it was really great. I can see how some people compare this to BCNR and while I like BCNR's more grandiose approach to their stuff I can appreciate what Squid is doing here. Songs like 'Narrator' or 'Pamphlets' are so unbelieveable fun even if I found them a bit long. 'Pamphlets' also happens to have an awesome music video so that definitely helps it's case and this entire album in general is just a really fun time.
