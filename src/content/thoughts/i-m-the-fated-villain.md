I get that the MC is a villain and that's the whole idea but also how does the author expect me want a mc to succeed after he rapes someone? Like what the fuck. And it is treated with about the tact you'd expect of a manhua author, they tried to make it into a joke and from what I hear later on she's gonna fall in love with him?? Does the author think that absolves him?? Anyways if you have any disagreements with my take I suggest you kill yourself because the world would be better off without you anyways.
