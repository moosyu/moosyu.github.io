Had some pretty awesome moments, especially at the start, 'Burn the Witch' is an almost perfect intro song in my opinion but it was just kind of boring at some points too, especially 'Desert Island Disk' that song was garbage. It also felt samey a lot of the time which didnt help its situation.

Edit: 7 -> 8, Radiohead as a band has grown on me recently and so I decided to relisten and it seems this album has grown on me too. Very beautiful album with some real bangers, 'Decks Dark' especially.
