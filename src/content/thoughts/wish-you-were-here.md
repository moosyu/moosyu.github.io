I really liked this album but I think I would have liked it a lot more if there wasn't a 10 hour long build up to every song, also my mum has the vinyl which is pretty cool.

Edit: 8.2 -> 9.5, grew on me quite a crazy amount, my least favourite song is still 'Welcome to the Machine' but if I'm being honest it's a banger too, this album is bullet proof and deserves the hype.
