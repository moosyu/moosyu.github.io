I was pretty hyped about this album but it turned out to be a bit of a let-down. I wasn't a giant fan of the more EDM-y vibes coming from this project, I found it a little too reminiscent of BRAT which is a shame because I think BRAT is a way better album in every aspect, not to say FKA twigs was copying Charli, I just feel like she could have done sometimes more with this idea.

I also wasn't super interested in the album messaging-wise, it just feels like it's saying something that's already been said over and over. The whole idea of Eusexua too, like sure it's nice to feel good about yourself and be free, all that but to be completely honest I just don't find that a very captivating idea to make an album about. I'm sure my score will increase over time as I give time for this album to sit as my expectations were clearly way too high but for now I'll give it a 3. To be honest I'm not even sure why I'm so disappointed, it's not like FKA twigs is one of my favourite artists or anything but who knows.
