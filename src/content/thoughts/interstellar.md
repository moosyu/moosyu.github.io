Now my second favourite film of all time. Genuine masterpiece and watching this was probably my favourite thing thats happened to me in the year 2024, either my life is sad or the the film is just that good (probably both).

Edit: 10 -> 9, sorry but I just kind of never went back to this, I still think back to it fondly but for a 10 it really should've stuck with me more.
