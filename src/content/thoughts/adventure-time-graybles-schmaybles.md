This comic was basically just a classic Graybles episode. It start off pretty good with Mr Pig and Tree Trunks turning it into a porn being a highlight, so was this one lady doing an exposition dump that everyone else but us already knew and then everyone getting pissed off at her. It felt like a great way to subvert a method of exposition I usually consider super lazy. What I did find lazy were some of the jokes being references to things the people saying them could've never experienced like when Finn called a riot "like a sports riot". Why did this guy specify that? In fact it would've made more sense for him to just say it's like a riot. The only thing I could think of is that maybe Finn watched a sports riot video which would've made it make sense to know about one and also for the reference to be so clunky but nah I think they just fucked up. The jokes also just get worse as this goes on, maybe the writer forgot how to write funny things as time went on, I really don't know. It was a real shame though. I did like that Finn and Jake got to learn about the Graybles guy, that was cool, so was seeing BMO fuck around making shit at the end.
