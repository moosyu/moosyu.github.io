People in New Zealand often try to pretend that the only good NZ artist isnt Lorde, claiming that 1814 or SIX60 are somehow on the same level as her. I've listened to SIX60, I've listened to 1814 (because Spotify is shoving them down my throat) and they don't stand a chance, Lorde could make don't forget your roots any day of the week but SIX60 could never make Liability. This is easily one of the best synthpop albums of all time. I'm never going to listen to solar power they cant make me.
