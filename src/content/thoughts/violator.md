I was sceptical at the start of World In My Eyes, I was like 30 seconds in and felt like this album was gonna be dogshit but I was throwing it back by the end of it so I guess I know nothing. This was one of the best synthpop albums I've ever heard in my life, behind maybe just Spirit Phone, Imaginal Disk and Melodrama (and maybe Currents too but I'm still figuring out how I feel about that one). It's like the old ass men in Depeche Mode were seducing me or something. The best song was either Personal Jesus or Policy of Truth and it was crazy when I realised I've heard Enjoy the Silence a bunch of times and just didnt know it was by these guys. Blue Dress was by far the worst song and kind of brought this album down a lot. That shit was way too long for its own good and so boring. For sure a skip on relistens.
