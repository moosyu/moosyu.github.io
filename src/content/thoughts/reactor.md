Not as good as chaser, though chaser is one of my favourite albums of all time so that'd be pretty hard. Despite that, this album had a real kick to it. I've loved Weightless, dinner and M3 N MIN3 since their first release and songs like IT'S TIME go crazy hard. I'd really love to have heard M3 N MIN3 for the first time on this album because hearing the Danny check was so hype. I'd like for more variety in femtanyl's next release as the formula is getting a little repetitive though I'll keep listening to her music even if she just does this forever she my goat fr. I also had Chromokopia queued by accident and the transition from IT'S TIME and Darling, I is pretty good.
