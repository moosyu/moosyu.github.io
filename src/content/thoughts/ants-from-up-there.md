Idk what Billie Eilish style is but bars. I can seriously listen to this album over and over and not get tired of it, everything is booming and grand, it's like being hit with a wave of sound but the wave sick as hell and it's awesome and super cool I think I'm losing my mind but this album is sick as hell please listen to this shit I was hooked by the second song it's totally worth your time.
