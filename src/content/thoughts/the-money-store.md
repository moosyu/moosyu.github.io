This album got me drenched in sweat by the end of it. It's like a gateway drug to more experiemental hiphop aswell as a gateway into crack. Idk if id say you should buy this as the bdsm type cover probably wont leave a good impression on your friends and family.

Edit: 10 -> 9.5, I found it impossible to forgive Fuck That being on here sorry guys.
