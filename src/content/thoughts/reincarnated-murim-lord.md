While Reincarnated Murim Lord is a just another reincarnated old murim guy manhwa but it still managed to entertain me (though most murim entertains me so this isn't a huge surprise but I swear it did some interesting things). Of course it has all the normal stuff, he wakes up in a new body as a stupid loser guy and trains up to be strong again, but I did appreciate how he seems to have dragged over at least a bit of wisdom from his previous life which made for some nice introspective scenes. I thought the scenes where he looked back on how he treated his mother were sweet and so were the moments when he saw the faults in his old way of life and tried to change his new one. 

 The art is pretty nice too, it feels unique and detailed, though it did feel a bit like they blew the backgrounds budget on the first few chapters. Luckily the artists use of free assets are used pretty sparingly and don't stand out too often but that doesn't change the fact that the characters fighting in empty voids took me out of it at points. I'd have appreciated some more originality in the main story as a lot of it feels like just going through the motions of what a murim manhwa should be like but I guess this is just what sells... 

 If you're already a fan of the murim genre like me I'm sure you'll enjoy this but it still isn't doing anything particularly special at the moment so I'm a bit mixed on it though only 68 chapters in as writing this, there's still a chance this manhwa gets better.
