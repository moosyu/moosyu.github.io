Probably the last time I'll read an English webtoon. I don't know how to say this but they all give off such an aura of being gay, it's like the same vibe tumblr gives off. Even the straight ones give it off. This isn't even to say I'm homophobic, I've straight up read manhwa closer to gay porn and it's felt less gay then this. I truly cannot explain it. Sadly this one doesn't have the quality nevermore does to offset that.
