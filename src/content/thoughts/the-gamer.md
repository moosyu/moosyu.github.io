title: "The Gamer"
type: Manhwa
score: 1.5
---

Just going through my backlog of bad manga I dropped at this point. The Gamer is shit straight from the start till (I assume) the end. The art is genuinely awful, often worse then Tower of God but where Tower of God (somewhat) succeeded in story, The Gamer didn't and was just felt silly all the way. The art also somehow managed to never improve.
