Incredibly beautiful album and what I feel is the culmination of Radiohead's efforts over the years. Not a single song on this project is underwhelming and I love every one of them individually. With songs like Bodysnatchers which feels like a more polished and more mature version of their sound from their first few albums with grainy guitars and an infectious energy about it to the sombre All I Need which ended up being my favourite song on this album, it's slow and beautiful and made me cry when I first heard it. It's just so peak. Every song just feels like it's meant to be there, the tracklist flows so perfectly, even Faust Arp which everyone shits on feels essential to maintaining the albums vibes for me. I'm almost certainly doing this album a disservice with my review so I'd just listen to it for yourself if you haven't already, you'll thank me later I'm sure.
