A collection of great songs from my goat? There is no way I wouldn't love this. Despite that this felt a bit long as it was like three hours so I had to do shit intermittently. I think this might have hit a lot harder too if they actually broke up but due to me living in the future I know they didn't.

Edit: 8 -> 9, this album has grown on me a lot, some of the rawest and most passionate performances from James here especially on all my friends (this might be my favourite version of that song). Just an incredible album over all, I still stand by my previous criticisms but I think the quality of this album kind of overrules them.

Edit: 9 -> 10, fuck my life. While it's still not exactly something I'd call a perfect album I'd say that the long goodbye is a testament to how fucking good this band is. The fact that this three hour long smorgasbord of an album has maybe five misses for me is so insane and it's not just all my friends that had the best version of it on this, there are so many: dance yrself clean, you can't hide (which is a live original I believe but still), i can change, you wanted a hit, tribulations, someone great, all i want, home and that's just a shortlist of my favourites. There are so many great reimagined parts of songs in here (some of which took some taking used to admittedly but grew on me). I know I'm kind of rambling but I dunno really what to say, it's just so peak. Go listen to the original home and then this albums nightcore sped up remix and contemplate or something.
