Can't wait for Silksong to come out in 4063! Best metroidvania of all time though, super fun and extremely rewarding when you finally beat a hard boss. I will continue to replay this game until Silksong releases, if only I could have more than four saves.

Edit: 10 -> 9.5, sorry to do this to you my beloved Hollow Knight but after playing Silksong I finally realise how lacking in proper storytelling this game was when Silksong managed to do it so much better and in a way that didn't need me to watch a Youtube video to understand.
