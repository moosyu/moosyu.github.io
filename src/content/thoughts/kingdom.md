Big fights between big Chinese men, peak fiction. The story is entertaining and the stakes are always high because even though the mc can't die it feels like anyone can die at any moment. My only issue is there's a lot of pedo shit and I get like its ancient china its probably realistic but dude, nobody was wiping out dozens of soliders in a single sword swing I don't think you were aiming for too much realism here.
