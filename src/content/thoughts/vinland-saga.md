The art is stunning, the characters interesting, especially Askeladd and Thorfinn who both are horrible people who have done horrible things but you can't help but enjoy their presences. Thorkell is also really entertaining to watch and is basically a Dorohedoro character. My only gripes with this series are that it feels so grounded in reality that when a silly manga moment or something outlandish happens it really takes me out of it and that the whole idea of having no enemies just seems too idealistic in such a realistic world (for a manga at least).
