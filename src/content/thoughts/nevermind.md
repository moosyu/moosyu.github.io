A hot take but this is not a top 100 of all time, it's very good and I think I have an idea of why people love it so much but it just doesn't do as much for me as I thought it would. I didn't like how it peaked on track #1 either. Edit: 7.5 -> 8, past me clearly wasn't listening carefully as you'll find Lithium was the best track on this album.
