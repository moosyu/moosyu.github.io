This album is an overrated piece of shit that forced me to switch to mono because its got that annoying ass half in one ear half in the other thing going that gives me a headache. I read a bunch of reviews talking about how cinematic the album was and I just didn't feel that, it felt empty and bored me to death. The 20 points were mercy points.
