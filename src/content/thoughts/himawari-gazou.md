After seeing thelemonbreadd's day one review of this I decided to check it out and over the past couple of days I've just let this run in the background while I study and I'm pretty sure my brain tuned it out after like an hour, I don't know why white noise is rated so highly but alright. The only times I really noticed it was when it got real repetitive during some sections that I just had to skip because I don't want to develop a brain tumour. None of the songs on here are good, just ranging between bad and mid.
