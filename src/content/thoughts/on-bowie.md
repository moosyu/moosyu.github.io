Lots of interesting David Bowie info but holy fuck the glaze in this book is insane. Like I'm a big David Bowie fan, I'm reading a book about him after all but this guy is on another level. It feels like every page or two we get a little interjection from this guy talking about how hot and sexy Bowie is and how everyone nearby wanted to fuck him like cmon man 😭.
