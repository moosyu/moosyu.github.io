This shit is so ass. I mean I already didn't love the original book but at the same time I wanted to see how the gods actually looked because my imagination is fucked up and generally makes things look stupid as hell but checking this out was a mistake. First off, it looks dead terrible, the normal graphic novel artstyle usually isn't my thing but this just looks extra cheap and sloppy, every character's expression looks dumb as hell and the fight scenes especially were way too slow. The story was also just worse in this, I guess they only have a hundred and fifty or so pages to work with so they just skipped loads of stuff, some pretty important so any chance of the pacing being good was immediately destroyed. I'd also just like to complain for a quick second about how hard this thing was to find. It took me like an hour to find this illusive ass book just for it to be ass, real salt in the wound.
