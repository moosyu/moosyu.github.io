Just finished this shit and WHAT THE FUCK WAS THE SECOND HALF. IM ACTUALLY TWEAKING SO MUCH WHATTTT. 'Like Him' had me floating and Balloon sent me fucking intersetellar. 'Take Your Mask Off' was also straight beautiful. Not much more to say but my goat is still alive and I'm so happy right now.

Edit: 9.4 -> 9.5 This album has grown on me since release and I can't stop listening to it. The songs hit hard and go hard.
