Honestly, aged better than I thought. I imagined this was going to be straight dogshit but apart from a lot of the dialogue feeling stupid, which seems like a trademark of Marvel these days, I enjoyed this. The story of how he became the iron man felt like an alright origin (though I feel like making a robotic fighting suit can't have been the easiest way to escape a terrorist prison, but when you're watching a superhero film realism takes a bit of a backseat to dumb fun (and it was). I appreciate that they put in some character development for Tony, with him going from snarky jackass to a little less snarky jackass, so much like me fr. The CGI (or practically effects, whatever they had going on) held up reasonably well too, it had some bad moments, that scene with Tony was being chased by the two fighter jets especially, but generally when Tony was inside the suit it looked pretty good, the sound design was pretty nice too. I'll have some trouble forgiving the slide transition though, PowerPoint shit.

While I forgave unrealistic moments earlier I'd have still have really loved if they gave Tony a better villain. In theory the Obadiah seems decent, evil business partner, he has motives and means, they even have a reveal where it's like oooo he was bad the whole time!! But the reveal didn't really work because the motherfucker just looked evil, I had him pinned as a villain instantly but even then he wasn't all that good as a villain. I wish he had more personality than just being an evil money man, it's a superhero movie guys, pick something more out there. Maybe I'm just saying this after Thanos setting the bar of a Marvel villain at a passable level I dunno.
