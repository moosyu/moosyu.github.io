Not the vibe I was feeling at the I heard it sadly. The rapping felt a little too fast and repetitive for me. The beats didn't do much for me either, I saw someone calling this the best produced rap album in decades and I simply wasn't feeling that. I feel like the beats could've been pushed a bit further and they didn't really sound like they were complimenting the beats.
