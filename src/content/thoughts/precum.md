I don't really care to make a proper review for this as this was a short boring album (nvm I ended up writing enough). I appreciate that Ayesha is at least trying something new production wise but this mixing is genuinely nightmarishly awful, like I cannot even comprehend how this happened. Also I get that having super sexual lyrics and all is basically her entire brand but after a decade of this it does get tiring and the songs don't bang nearly enough to cancel this out like was the case on some of her older songs. I know this might be a bit of an insane thing to say considering my favourite album of all time is The New Sound which I've seen countless people disregard because of the lyrical content but there I felt like it served a purpose and Greep was almost creative to a point of detriment. On here however it just feels like Ayesha is painfully unimaginative and hasn't had a new idea in years which kind of sucks. Listening to Emo Boy eight times would be vastly superior to listening to this album. That's about it, I'll leave you with a snippet of a review from AOTY I found funny though: "the production is fairly challenging but in the same way it is challenging to paint while having no hands and being blindfolded" - edgyrras.
