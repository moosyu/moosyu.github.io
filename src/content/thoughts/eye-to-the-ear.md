Some of the stuff like 'Marvellous Clouds', 'I Did And I Don't And I Do', 'By Being With You' and 'Interdimensional' had me floating but I thought the majority of the middle had very little to it and I ended up zoning out a bit. This was certainly interesting though, not sure if I've ever heard something quite like this before and I imagine it requires a certain mood to enjoy fully.
