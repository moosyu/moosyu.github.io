Generally sloppy and unfortunately the author had like an anime gooner incel vibe you can feel through the screen, not to mention the Redditor-esque sense of humour that the vast majority of the jokes have but sometimes it also manages to be funny so I can't quite disregard it. It helps that generally the art is pretty good even if a lot of the effort was put into the author skin puppeteering this girl around, I know I sound insane but read it and you'll get what I'm saying.
