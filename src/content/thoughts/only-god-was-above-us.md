Vampire Weekend got me wanting to wear a beanie. Every song slaps and I thoroughly enjoyed this on first listen and second and third. Probably on like 10th by now at least. Great album.

Edit: 8.5 -> 7.5, I've been on my BKNR shit and honestly I think Vampire Weekend could have pushed further on this album, still good though just doesn't hit the same.
