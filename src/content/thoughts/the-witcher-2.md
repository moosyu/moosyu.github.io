Honestly no clue how this is the same series as the Witcher 1, the combat is fun (even though it seems like some people didn't like it), the game looks incredible and the sound design is very good. The main issue I had was a few bugs (not nearly as many as the first game though) and it just got boring and kind of exhausting to play at some points.
