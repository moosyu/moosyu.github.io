One of the most fun albums I've heard in quite a long time. I'm not sure if the lyrics are super heavy or anything but I just had a really good time with this and I can't stop listening to the opening track, makes me want to get shit done around here.

Edit: 8.5 -> 7.5, just can't find myself returning to this one as often as expected.
