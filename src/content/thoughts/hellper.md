The author really thought hell and then wrote one of the most well made comics ever with great art, fights and characters. 

 Edit: This is a stupid ass review I don't know what I thought I was up to. 

 Edit 2: Had a reread and thought I'd hopefully explain my thoughts a little more coherently. Super cool manhwa, the artstyle is a unique mix of black and white (red, blue and purple too) in hell and coloured panels for the surface (it's cooler than it sounds, trust). The art also really compliments the big, sick ass fights too. Every character has a super unique design and fighting style, it's so cool. The comedy isn't much but it makes the manhwa better than if it didn't have it. The story too, while it feels a little frantic at the end is massively entertaining to watch play out, especially with a MC as charismatic as Jang.
