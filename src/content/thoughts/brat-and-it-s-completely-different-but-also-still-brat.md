type: Album
score: 1.5

Even though album is way worse than the original by a fair bit I still think its a good time and 'Girl, so confusing featuring lorde' is way better than the original and one of the best songs this year.

Edit: Actually I just heard the Yung Lean feature again and wow that song is dogshit I'm not even sure this is good.

Edit: Another edit, this has grown off me even more, the 'Mean girls' remix is awful, as is 'So I', 'I might say something stupid' and 'I think about it all the time'.

Edit: Alright last edit, third listen after I saw that somehow this had a critic score of 87 and it was even worse than the first two times. Now I am fairly sure I like this less than Vultures 2.
