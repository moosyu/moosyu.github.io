Buggy mess with graphics that look somehow high quality and also like ass at the same time. Like seeing one of those unreal engine template games, all the characters look so out of place and their models just lowkey suck ass like how did they end up looking this dogshit. Didn't expect much from the voice acting or writing any it still let me down too. Spent more time clipping through walls than playing the actual game, how hard is a solid floor as a concept for these guys.
