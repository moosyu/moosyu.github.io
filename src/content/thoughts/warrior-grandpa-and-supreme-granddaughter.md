This is so ass but I can't stop reading someone help 😭. The art is pretty bad and the story beats are pretty predictable with every change made somehow making it worse but I still can't resist. It's messed up. By the way I cannot for the life of me fathom why they transformed the grandad into some like little kid, why didn't they just make him like hot or something. I deadass cannot take a single thing he says serious any more, though this isn't really all that serious so its not too awful. It's also lowkey annoying watching this old ass mf get beat up over and over, I know he's not meant to be the strongest but he needs a buff so badly, it just feels like every fight has someone on the brink of death and just before they die someone blocks the other guy then beats there ass, way too formulaic. I'm unsure as to what keeps me reading this but it's messing me up.
