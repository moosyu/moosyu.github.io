This is like seeing nice looking food, biting into it and finding out its fucking hollow.

Edit: This might be bars? Go off me. Anyways Komi genuinely is a pretty substance-less manga (ironic for me to be saying this, I know). I'm writing this about a year after having read it and the only thing I can remember was the admittedly pretty good ending to the whole love triangle situation. For a manga with 500 chapters you'd definitely expect to remember more than that even if the chapters are pretty short. It's quite unfortunate that it ended up this bad as the main cast is really quite good (Komi, Tadano, Manbagi and Osana) but they kept adding these lame ass gag characters that ruined any semblance of pacing and the sense of humour this manga has really does nothing for me. Had it been 100 compact chapters with only the best stuff going on this would've been really good, but alas.
