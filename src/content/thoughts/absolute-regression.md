Absolute Regression manages to be its own thing in the oversaturated world of murim manhwa completely because the vibes are completely fucked, I don't know how this happened but I think I love it for it. There wasn't a single interaction in this manhwa that I found believable in any way but every character's autistic energy eventually became very charming to me and watching them bumble around talking crazy was extremely entertaining. Watching the MC and his father stare each other down after every sentence during every scene together as the lighting on them increases in quality for no reason was simply peak and unintentionally hilarious. The reason the author chose to do it like this is unknowable and I imagine you have to read it yourself to understand what I'm on about at all, but it should at least be an intriguing draw if anything. 

 The art on the other hand has nothing off about it, shits stunning. This manhwa has so many cool ass long panels, I attached one below but there are are dozens I could've picked from. The fight scenes in particular are always a highlight of any chapter that has them, they're bright and over the top, all I could want from a murim fight. Not just that though, even some more mundane scenes end up looking crazy because this artist seems to have a real aptitude for making long ass horizontal panels that really bring you into this manhwa in a way I don't think I've ever seen done to quite the same extent before. I also really liked the way facial expressions are done, it really adds to the weird, awkward vibes that every interaction has. Little grins and facial movements that feels so unnatural but still manage to make me believe that just maybe these weirdos could have something behind their eyes after all really make this for me. 

 I recommend Absolute Regression, but if you don't enjoy the dialogue between the father and son in the first five or so chapters I'd just give up right there because you'd be wasting your time reading any more. I'm sorry to say but this is just about the most the author can do when it comes to not making his characters feel like skinwalkers.
