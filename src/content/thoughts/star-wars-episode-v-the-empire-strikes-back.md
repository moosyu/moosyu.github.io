Wayy better than the first, you can really tell the budget went up as just about everything looks better, bigger too. I liked how this film had the gang going to lots more places and actually seeing the galaxy, giant worms and all as I feel that's the most compelling aspect of Star Wars. A snowy planet is always cooler than a desert one and temperature being an actual concern even just at the start was pretty cool too. Some of the CGI and greenscreening was fucked up so it was lucky Yoda was just a silly puppet guy, lowkey fit his character too. The Darth Vader father reveal is probably the most iconic moment in Star wars and the force actually being a thing in this movie was cool too. The relationship between Leia and Han Solo was a little wack though as George Lucas clearly didn't really put much thought into romance in these movies so it does make me wonder why he added it at all.
