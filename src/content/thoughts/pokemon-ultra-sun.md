Thanks Citra, very cool. Edit: Nintendo put Citra down I can't believe this shit. Edit 2: When I was a bit younger this was easily my favourite Pokemon game and while it still is I replayed it and lowkey this shit trash. 30fps feels so sluggish, it's so easy I literally can and did beat it with a single Pokemon and the story is dogshit. I know the last two are because it was made for like toddlers but it it still sucks.
