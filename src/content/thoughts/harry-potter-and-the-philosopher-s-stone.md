I probably won't be writing all that much but I'll be writing my thoughts for every Harry Potter movie so hopefully it turns out like the length of one normal comment. This is the first Harry Potter film and honestly the weakest imo, the kid actors do alright but it feels like mainly a setup for later films, the antagonist is kind of a nothing character, the slapstick isn't all that funny and I had to to see far too much of the Dursleys. There was some pretty good worldbuilding though as even despite the shoddy early 2000s CGI this is one of the only films that makes you feel like you're watching some kind of magic world, that might just be the nostalgia talking though as I hold all of these films dear to my heart.
