This album needs more luv (still got it). This is one of the most beautiful pieces of media I have ever heard. I was crying by pt 3 and I was completely bawling by the finale. I cant even articulate how great this album is, it's just one of those things you have to hear for yourself. Even the remixes are super high effort and worth your time. I cant believe I just found out about this. I know this is rambly but I just cannot possibly articulate my thoughts on this right now, please just listen to it.

Edit: 10 -> 9.5, it hurts but this album has grown off me a little.
