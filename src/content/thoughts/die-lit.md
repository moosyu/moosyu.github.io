I guess I just don't get Carti, this is his highest rated project and it still only bordered on being good for me. There were some great moments like Choppa Won't Miss but a lot just felt like bloat to me. Edit: 6.6 -> 5, fuck you Carti drop I AM MUSIC soon or I'm going to keep relistening to this and realising I don't like it as much as I did before.
