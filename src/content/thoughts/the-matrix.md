Very cool film that still holds up unlike some of the ass CGI ive seen from its era.

Edit: 8.2 -> 6.5, I'm not sure what happened but I don't really like this film as much as I once did, maybe it's because I can hear Andrew Tate's voice in my ear everytime I watch it now but I also feel like while the CGI (or VFX I don't know the names of things) isn't terrible you can definitely tell it's from the early 2000s. On top of that the editing in this movie is really weird, there are lots of cuts that just seem to happen half a second too fast and especially in scenes with people talking it makes it feel like the people aren't even talking to each other.
