Great start and it's really cool when you understand every part of it. The art and panelling are great and Urasawa makes everything oddly cinematic. I like almost all of the cast especially Otcho, the story kind of drags but I was still interested the whole time. The ending was a massive fumble in my opinion even if you include 21st Century Boys as the same manga, prior to the ending I considered 20th Century Boys to be a high 9 maybe even a 10 but if you don't include 21st Century Boys I would say it becomes a high 8. The final reveal was dissatisfying and I still had questions left even after the end.
