When I think NIN I certainly don't think synthpop but that's what I got in this album and I really enjoyed it. I listened to this on a recommendation and I was a little worried as I had heard about how heavy a lot of the NIN stuff is but apart from a few moments it seemed my fear was unfounded. Even if it had some weaker moments especially into the second half this was a really great album that might just make me listen to the rest of their stuff.
