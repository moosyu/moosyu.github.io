I decided it was about time to take another viewing of the Star Wars series as the last time I had checked them out was ~2015 which was quite some time ago now. I don't really remember watching this film specifically despite knowing everything that happens in it, I'm not sure if I had just forgotten or that's just how iconic a film series Star Wars is but whatever.

First off, it's so weird they started with a Star Wars named Episode IV, it seems like it's because George Lucas is a freak and thought it'd make it feel more like you were just dropped into the middle of action which is a little weird because this totally wasn't the middle of action but ok awesome George. The film itself was technically impressive with a story that seems so large even now however the actual execution of this was just a shit imho. Mark Hamill especially really doesn't do it for me as an actor in this and even the actors I like more like Carrie Fisher as Leia have dialogue that doesn't feel all too realistic to me. C3PO is also just super fuckin annoying and there was too many scenes of characters speaking these made up languages, I'd rather be unimmersed than have to sit through all this. The sets are generally very well done however I do gotta say that Tatooine really doesn't feel like another planet some of the time especially when you can see mountains in the distance, I dunno. It's also just really stupid how the Death Star has a place you can shoot that instantly blows everything up. That's about all I can think up, I gotta write like eight more of these can't put too much thought into it.
