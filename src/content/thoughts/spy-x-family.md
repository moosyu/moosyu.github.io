The dad is a Spy (x Family). I get it.

Edit: 7 -> 7.5, Ok so it's been a couple years since I first wrote this nothing comment about this manga and I've kept up with it, even reread it once. It's nothing super new but it's just interesting enough, just cute enough, to keep me coming back every week. I'd love if they picked up the pace romance-wise, I don't know if it's a good sign that I've waited two years and absolutely nothing substantial has happened between these two. Do I need to leave it for another two?
