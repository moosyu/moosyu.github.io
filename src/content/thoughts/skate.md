I could've sworn I did a review of this a few months ago but whatever. I've only played this game once but I think I got a good idea of what was going on that time, less than 10 minutes into the game it showed me its shop despite being early access which already gave me a bad taste in my mouth but what really sent me over the edge how buggy this thing is. First off after having played the game for less than an hour I somehow had the gravity just forget it was a thing for me twice sending me flying directly into concrete when rolling up a small hill, then the game crashed and finally once I got back in I tried to join one of my mate's parties and it just didn't work. The screenshot attached is an error message of that and after almost half an hour of trying we just gave up and played Fortnite instead. What a game.
