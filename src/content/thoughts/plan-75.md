It seems I'm finding myself listening to a lot of BCNR-esque albums trying to sate my thirst for a new project from them. This one though feels more impressive than the underwhelming La Brea. While it's clearly taken inspiration from Squid and BCNR in its dramatics and vocals this feels like its actually trying someone new with the formula instead of just copying it word for word. Perhaps its because of the short runtime but I really found myself enjoying this EP, the instrumentals were very nice, I quite enjoyed some of the more guitar heavy rock moments especially and while the vocals were very Squid I like Squid vocals so I'm pretty fine with it. By the way, I don't mean to call every new art rock album a BCNR clone but from where I'm standing this seems to take some pretty clear inspiration from lots of pretty popular art rock outfits, especially BCNR and Maruja.

Edit: 7 -> 6.5, sorry I just don't feel like ever returning to this EP so I can't really call it good can I? Didn't really do anything that left an impact.
