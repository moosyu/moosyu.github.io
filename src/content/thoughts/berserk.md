I don't know how to explain this but the swings feel so real in Berserk, like I can feel them and can tell when guts gets stronger just by how impactful his swings are and I hear an audible boom anytime he swings Dragon Slayer, you see the wind up and then just destruction, no wind up, just slow and deliberate movements and then the explosion of whoever he was fighting. The eclipse was actually peak like it got built up so well by people talking about it so you knew it was bad and then it happened and holy shit it was just as bad as they built it up to be.
