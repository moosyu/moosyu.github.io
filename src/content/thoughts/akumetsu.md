Action packed with a protagonist that is fun to watch, has actual goals and a code of conduct with great art and some of the most creative scenes I've ever seen. Only problem is that this is a criticism of the Japan when it was released and its getting pretty old having ended in 2006 and also I'm not japanese so it takes a little bit of research for some it to make sense (also the one man one kill thing is kind of true but they are all the same guy so its debatable but its fine I guess). The massive text walls are also a bit of a turn off.
