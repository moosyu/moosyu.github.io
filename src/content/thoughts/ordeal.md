I desperately wanted to like this series, there just aren't that many with cool massive fights, good art, unique powers and characters that aren't all skinny twinks and yet all this excitement was quickly destroyed for me when I started to actually read it. I don't mean to be rude but this guy really doesn't seem good at any aspect of writing aside from maybe the characters who are all quite distinct. I didn't find the story super engaging, it gave the appearance of being unique but the longer I read the more I came to realise how cliche a lot of this is and it only took about 20 chapters to realise what the issue I was sensing was. This dude is wayy too in manga (or anime whatever). It's so blindingly obvious and offputting, reading this was like reading Dog Nigga but at least the guy writing that one was very aware of what he was doing and it made for some funnier moments where he subverted the norm. Here that is unfortunately not the case. The best part of the story was the alternate history aspect but that aspect also pissed me off because why would you even bother adding all that if history progressed in almost the same way as in our world. Like wouldn't it have been crazy if Hitler won this time round or something? Instead once you get to the real story you're tragically awoken to the fact that it's just a hodgepodge of tropes from shonen manga I've already read. This guy even named the powers Kimyos and had fuckers saying nani like I know what you are...

I really didn't mean to go so hard in this but this shit was really welling up in my chest I guess. I read this: https://webtoons.com/en/creators101/webtoon-canvas/creator-story/1 and the creator of this Webtoon does seem like a genuinely good guy who does actually care but I'd say he'd do a much better job being just an artist for something (I cannot give justice to how good the art for this is, especially compared to most comics).
