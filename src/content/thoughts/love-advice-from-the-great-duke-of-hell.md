Me when jokes are actually funny.

Edit: 9 -> 8, I'm sorry my beloved but after Vampire Family's insanely good first season I've been forced to come to terms with how weak some sections of this Webtoon are. Obviously the jokes are top notch, probably the best to come out of a Webtoon but this whole story is really unbalanced. It's very clear the author didn't really have any plans going into it with how drasticly the tone shifts later on. Most of the first season is just gag comedy which is great but then it shifts pretty hard into a more drama-filled series in the following seasons. It just gives me the vibe the author was pretty unprepared to write an ongoing story.
