C is a pass its fine. Combat was fun but I don't really like games that have like a rating based on how many things I kill, it really stresses me out to be honest. Similar situation to how I felt about Devil May Cry 5 however that game had the benefit of looking stunning while Ultrakill looks like shit I can't lie to you, the aesthetic it has is so overdone even if it's likely this popular now in part due to Ultrakill's success, doesn't really change the situation for me.
