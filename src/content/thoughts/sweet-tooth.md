Dumbass fucking kid getting caught in this Hansel and Gretel shit. Some fairly entertaining stuff and honestly I'll watch anything post apocalyptic at this point, though I wish there was more stuff with apocalypses not caused by viruses. The OST works well and for a kid actor, or just an actor in general, the kid playing the main character is actually really good. Some of the scenery is really beautiful as well. The mystery aspect was pretty good and I liked how the whole story was pieced together and it gave you a moment where you're like ohhh, that makes sense now. Sadly the show kind of went to shit after the first season feeling way less coordinated and interesting. Really lost its steam by the end and honestly I just didn't care by that point.
