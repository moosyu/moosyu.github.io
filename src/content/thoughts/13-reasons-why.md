I had been meaning to get around to watching this show as it's pretty iconic even if it's often not talked about super positively. To be honest as I'm writing this having not finished the entire show but I doubt there will be any more surprises especially after it kind of plummeted in quality after season one and I didn't even think season one was good. Like why was most of season one Clay walking up to people and they're like fuck off and then leave?? I'll be sure to update this if the situation changes though.

I really didn't like much of this show, the characters didn't really have enough chemistry to bounce off each other and lighten the obviously pretty depressive atmosphere. Everyone was angry or sad or both all the time and it's pretty draining to sit through especially with such a long show. But the character I had the biggest issue with was Hannah, like I couldn't really feel super bad for her because got was she annoying and lowkey she needed to get off her high horse, seemed real manipulative too. Like big talk for someone who's dead holy shit. At least I liked Clay's parents, they were sweet and looked like they were trying their best.
