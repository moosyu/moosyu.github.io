type: Manhwa
score: 4.5

I usually read shit romance to relax me and to burn time. I love to complain about romance manhwa and manga being shit but if they get too good I just don't read them. This did most things well but tragically I hated almost everyone and it was a bit miserable at times so it definitely didnt relax me. It's a pretty good read if you like romance as a genre but if you're like me its kind of a slog to get through.
