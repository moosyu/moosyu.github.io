I don't get the appeal for these guys, maybe its because I'm not a furry but this album just never really clicked with me.

Edit: 5.2 -> 5.4 on a relisten it seems I am still not a furry but slightly more gay.

Edit 5 -> 3, just isn't it. This album has its moments (Sober to Death and My Boy) but a lot of it is boring, drawn out and gets grating  after a while. Maybe if this was more like a 40 minute album...
