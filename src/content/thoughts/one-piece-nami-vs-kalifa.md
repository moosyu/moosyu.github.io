Boichi is actually so shit at drawing girls its honestly insane. This feels closer to softcore porn then a oneshot. The fight is pretty good too but I just cannot read this with a straight face I just feel silly. 

 Edit: I made a full review on MAL so I thought I'd just copy it over here, at least you guys don't have the ability to confused react my reviews. 

 Has Boichi... seen a woman before? 

 I actually enjoy most of Boichi's fight scenes. This is because Boichi usually sticks in his lane and has men fighting because men are what he's good at drawing. Boichi really falls off when he does anything with women; they weren't well written or well drawn in Sun-Ken Rock, and they sure as hell aren't here either. 

 Boichi is seemingly completely perplexed by the female form and is physically capable of not drawing the most horny shit he can think of. Obviously, the actual One Piece isn't free from this either because Oda was the one who chose the outfits and the one who can't seem to stop himself from increasing the size of Nami's tits, but you know, anyone can wear whatever they want, and maybe Nami's boobs are just growing naturally (?? probably not though). Boichi though, is physically incapable of not doing a close up of their boobs or asses for a single second, and for some reason, Kalifa's clothes seem to be a lot tighter than the real fight. I wonder why. Also, Boichi draws women's eyes weird. 

 The actual fight is pretty decent; I'd even say better than the One Piece fight because it actually feels like a fight, not a conversation broken up by yelling weird move names. If only Boichi focused more on that, instead of focusing on finding out how many crotch shots he can get from Khalifa shot. This is made exclusivly for horny teenagers and even then, why would you read this when there is no actual nudity? Deeply confusing read.
