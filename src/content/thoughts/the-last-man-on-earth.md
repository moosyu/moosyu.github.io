I stopped watching this before I could even get past the first season because holy shit why is Phil such a dickhead. Like Carol is annoying, sure, but how am I meant to watch this guy be the worst all the time and hope things get better for him. Mayhaps if Phil actually told people what he was thinking he wouldn't be so bad but he doesn't and he is.

Edit: I actually ended up liking season two more because Phil spent a fair bit suffering, still weren't all that many funny jokes though unfortunately.
