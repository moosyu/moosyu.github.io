Feels a little overrated. The story was pretty bittersweet and I'm fine with that but his relationship with his family seemed a little underdeveloped and him being so pissed at them seemed like a bit much and made him come off as more a dick than I think he needed to be. Also sometimes the acting just felt a little bad and the line deliveries, a little unnatural.
