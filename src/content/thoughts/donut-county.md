The music isn't all that great but the actual gameplay is passable if a bit bland, though it is nice to have some curveballs thrown in every level like rabbits banging and whatnot. The story is kind of mid and I didn't like how sometimes even if something can fit into the hole you can't put it in until you reach a point either.
