I'm pretty sure I'm holding Kendrick to a standard too high but I can't help myself. How can I not compare this to his masterpieces and while good, it's just kind of a let down? It felt empty in beats and raps. The title track also sucked ass and made me want to kill myself in a record breaking three minutes. God I hope my goat isn't washed but from where I'm standing this seems like the beginning of the end.

Edit: 7 -> 8, you know what, this has grown on me a fair bit. Lots of really fun songs and I think I allowed my expectations of a Kendrick Lamar album to get in the way of enjoying this project fully. Find myself returning to this pretty consistently.
