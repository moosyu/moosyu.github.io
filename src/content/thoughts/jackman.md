I preferred him a lot more on Industry Baby and I think I will continue to only listen to him in Industry Baby.That's not because it's bad it's just because Industry Baby is that good. The actual album is alright, I liked 'They Don't Love It' the most but I really felt like this entire project Jack was just getting carried by his beats. I also feel like it needed to be longer than 22 minutes as it's not really a full album?? More like an EP idk.
