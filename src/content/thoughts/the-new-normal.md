Will is the gayest straight man alive. The production was there but it just felt like Will Wood was screaming at me to look at him showing me how wacky he is and shit and it came off as a little corny, though Laplace's Angel was pretty good and so was I / Me / Myself.

Edit: Maybe I was a little hash on you William Wood because Love, Me Normally is a banger and this album is just really comforting to me and only corny if you think about it 😎.
