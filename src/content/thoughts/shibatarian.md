Very unhinged, bizarre and surrealist though it was just too confusing a lot of the time for me, maybe I'm just stupid or something but it was quite disappointing. I did like some of the over the top set pieces that turned up though. The violence felt meaninglessly over the top a lot of the time, and the art isn't very dynamic so the fights seem kind of stilted. Feels like it should have been both longer and shorter and to be honest that probably just means it was just a bad concept, the ending was sweet though.
