Shockingly impressive album from Ron Weasley himself. It's mellow, jazzy and just wacky enough to still be fun without being too out there. I wouldn't say he's a good singer but in the same way that Cameron Winter or Phil Elverum aren't great singers either (imo ofc don't come after me please), that their vocals are so unique and different that it kind of makes up for it and even makes it better than if they were perfect with smooth voices and perfectly hitting the notes. I think a perfect example of this is Slush Puppy, King Krule's voice really carries this song and his weird tone and almost anguished crying vocals near the end absolutely add to the vulnerable and heavy atmosphere. It could've benefited from some trimming lengthwise but it's not a huge issue and doesn't drag too much, I deadass cannot believe Fantano gave this a 4 😭 are we deadass right now.
