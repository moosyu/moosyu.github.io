Space Oddity was beautiful I love David Bowie.

Edit: 8 -> 6.5, coming back to this one I was a little disappointed. It still looks generally great of course especially the landscape of mars however when it came to CGI this film really doesn't hold up because I'm sorry but any impact the rescue scene could've had is destroyed by how terrible it looks. On top of this, much of what I thought was good about it the first time I now know has been done in ways that interest me a lot more than The Martian. The emotional scenes also don't hit the same but that's kind of a given on a second watch.
