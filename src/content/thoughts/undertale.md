Sans! 

 Edit: 8 -> 9, I just replayed this game and its honest incredible. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and sets the mood perfectly, the combat is fun and engaging and the dialogue and little interactions you can have with the world are incredible. For just one of the many examples, that mirror in Toriel's that says 'Despite everything, it's still you' was just so charming, its the little attention to detail that Toby Fox put into Undertale is awe-inspiring and this games praise was absolutely deserved.
