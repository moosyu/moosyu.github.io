Yeah I really like sitting in complete silence for half of an album, part 1 of storm was literally my favourite start to any album of all time and somehow they still fumbled. I know this is meant to be more an art peice and I appreciate that but I still don't really care, I like albums that people play and you actually hear it, you know, driving a car hearing another car playing it, you know, go to the barbershop and you hear them playing it, you know, turn the radio on and you hear them playing it, you know, it's playing everywhere, it's called great music, it's called albums that you actually hear the songs, not no mysterious shit and you never hear it.
