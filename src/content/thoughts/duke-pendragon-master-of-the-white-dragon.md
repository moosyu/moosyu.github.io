Randomly seemed to appear out of nowhere, I think I've read a few other manhwa like this where they are just clearly missing something. I can't say for sure what it's missing but it fails to entertain me. Kind of reminds me of that manhwa where the girl was like working for the king but was also strong or something idk. The art also seemed to just degenerate overtime.
