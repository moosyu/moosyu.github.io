title: "Old School Runescape"
type: Game
score: 8.5
---

Played 100 hours in one week, worst mistake of my life. Runescape is the only open world game that makes me actually feel like I'm exploring a large and dangerous world as opposed to playing the same game over and over again which a lot of the modern games feel like also the music is peak. 

 Edit: I've taken an extended break and I've heard the game is going to shit but I'll have to check it out later.
