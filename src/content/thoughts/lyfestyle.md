I was talking to a friend about favourite musicians (because music is the only thing I'm capable of talking about ig). But they told me their favourite underground artist was Yeat and I've been fuming ever since for no reason because I'm just a hater ig. Anyways despite me coming in really wanting to hate this one I actually ended up liking it and it's kind of insane that Yeat made two albums that people liked in one year, very impressive output. Edit: 7.4 -> 6.5 I mean it's alright.
