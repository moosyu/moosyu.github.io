Everyone died at the start. 

 Edit: I dropped this one, why did they keep showing every fucking floor just skip like 20 please.

Edit 2: I'm sorry I lied, I undropped this. Honestly if you can get into the flow state of consuming slop it's pretty good and the idea of this guy not fighting the gods directly but instead commandeering a floor of the tower is really interesting so I'll keep following just for that even if the pace is painfully slow.
