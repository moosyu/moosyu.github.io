Probably one of my favourite live albums of all time?? This album was effortlessly fire and is just a 3rd LP in my heart. My favourite song on here was predictably Turbines/Pigs, the building up into explosions of sound is just immaculate and the female singers cooks, she isn't a pig she's being too hard on herself :( . Very excited for these guys next work.
