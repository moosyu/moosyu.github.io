Super weak whole first half with a real tonal whiplash where the film doesn't know if it wants to be silly or serious. Like it has these silly montages but also has everything going to shit and it doesn't really do it for me but manages to pick it up in the second half. Snape's relationship with Harry's father is one of the most interesting things in the whole series in my opinion as it really fleshes him out as one of if not the most interesting characters in the whole series. Apart from that though this film felt weak especially coming off the back of the great Goblet of Fire, the dialogue felt more dry (aside from some standouts like Snape and Ron's brothers, like the way Fred delivers "I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement" is just so peak). I also really liked the line "By which time I shall be gone and you shall be dead", I don't know if it was purposefully funny but it gave me a chuckle, however Dumbledore and Voldemort's fight would've looked a hell of a lot cooler without all those quick cuts and shaky camera movements. For some reason the director (or the author I dunno I've never read Harry Potter sorry) seemed to be going more and more in on moody Harry Potter which wasn't a super interesting character to watch, along with that it just kind of pissed me off how wilfully ignorant the ministry of magic though it's kind of exactly what's happening right now IRL (though I doubt IRL they can just kill the people in charge like they did here). Don't really like Luna either, she's just weird man though I was also just having an shit day when I watched this so that might've factored into how I feel about this.
