I spent like 10 straight minutes laughing at this shit how the fuck did this even happen. Did he not let anyone hear this?? How did Frank Zappa give this the thumbs up? Like who decided to put a fully spoken word 2 minute long section for the second song?? I literally felt like I was going insane listening to this shit, but I can't put an album that brought me so much joy below a 50, despite it deserving a 10. Would never listen to this again though.
