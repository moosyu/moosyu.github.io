Every man in this looks like a lesbian.

Edit: My favourite slop, the art growth is honestly insane and the story gives me warmth. Panneling is well used too, just really high quality slop manhwa.

Edit 2: Someone hold be back my plan to read list is too long but I can't stop rereading this instead it's just so charming.

 Edit 3: Jiwoo even lost a fight for like the second time ever in the recent chapters, this is some real shit.
