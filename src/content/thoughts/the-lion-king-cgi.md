type: Movie
score: 6.5

It was like the Lion King but worse, I don't know what to say, the CGI lions actually looked really good in my opinion (even though I didn't like the way their mouths moved) but it still felt worse than how they did it like 20 years ago. The same goes with everything else, the music felt more toned down and the story was just the lion king idk.
