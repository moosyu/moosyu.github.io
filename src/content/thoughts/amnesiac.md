I know people call this Kid B but aside from the absolutely awful 'Pulk / Pull Revolving Doors' which is Fitter Happier's dickhead older brother I actually think this might be better than Kid A. I prefer it being less ambient as something about Kid A's ambience doesn't sit right we me and while I've rated them the same due to Punk / Pull I think in general this was a more interested album to listen to.

Edit: 7.5 -> 7, this is not better to Kid A sorry guys I lied, it just doesn't seem to drag me back kicking and screaming the same way Kid A does.
