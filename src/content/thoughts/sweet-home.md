Me when something meant to be suspenseful is actually suspenseful!! Truly an impossible feat.

Edit: Really kind of undersold it here, so I'll give Sweet Home a little more love. Sweet Home is probably the best thriller manhwa out there. I know it's primarily sold to people as a horror manhwa (at least as I've seen), but unfortunately, it's not really all that scary. I'm not trying to say I'm a super macho guy who doesn't get scared; it's just that I'm not sure if something in this format can be genuinely scary...

As for the thriller element, however, it does a really good job. The author was seemingly willing to kill off people, which made the scenes of hiding properly tense. It helped that every character except that fat girl (thank god she died) was pretty likeable; the MC's mental health journey going on simultaneously with the whole world-ending monster situation was really cool and pretty uplifting too. It felt like every character had their own thing going on, which helped me be worried about what was going on with them; if these were the usual cardboard cutouts you find in manhwas, this would've been quite a lot harder. The story itself is pretty unique too; manhwas sadly severely lack them, and having one this good brings a tear to my eye. The monsters are also pretty cool and unique, even if it feels a little like after a point the new designs stop standing out so much; I guess they were less of the focus by that point. The ending was a little corny, but it was also sweet (home??), made me tear up a little, to be honest.
