Got sent Fozzih by a friend and liked it quite a lot so I decided to check out the rest of this album and it's just bad. It all kind of felt like a grey mush that I was wading through aside from some standouts. Maybe that's just what darkwave is but if that's the case I guess I don't like darkwave.
