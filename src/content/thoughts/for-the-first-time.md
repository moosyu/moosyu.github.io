Some of the tracks felt a little lacklustre especially compared to their later works but it was still a very good album, lots of bangers especially 'Science Fair', 'Sunglasses' and 'Opus'. It was a bit weird to hear Mr Road talking about Kanye, I don't know what that was about but I wonder if he too is as disappointed at Vultures as me.
