A surprisingly entertaining watch considering its a game about a board game but chess felt really intense in this especially the final match. Like I knew there was no way she'd lose but it still felt pretty epic to watch. There was also a few moments that got me a little choked up like when Beth finds out her mentor had been watching her all this time, what a fire moment. It was a little hard to watch Beth's life spiral into hell but I do hear that happening a lot with geniuses and it been rough to see was definitely intentional, didn't make it easy though. There were a few parts that felt a little sped through and I'd have probably liked this show more if it had maybe two seasons so they could properly flesh out some of Beth's life but idrc all that much and its not like Netflix to give a good show another season anyhow. Good watch, check it out if you can.
