I know everyone says it but this sounds like the cover, this is the kind of music you have to listen to with headphones because it's just too layered to listen to on a shitty phone speaker or something. I honestly couldn't imagine hearing this in 1991, I would be losing my mind. Could barely believe it myself and I was hearing it in the 2020s.
