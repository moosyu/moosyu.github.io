This is a pretty short 20-minute EP, so I don't have a huge amount to say about it, but I really quite liked it. I was recommended this by a friend who said it got him through some tough times, and I can definitely understand why he liked it so much. It's very sweet and earnest and manages to warp its vibes based on your mood, as I think most songs could easily be seen as either upbeat or depressing, though that's not super new for TV Girl. This album does lean more upbeat, however, especially on Laura, which had me nodding and tapping my feet with those little "lalala's" and those drums. The vocals are definitely more engaged than other TV Girl songs I've heard too, which was nice. It does kind of taper off near the end on the last couple of songs, as they don't sound all that exciting or interesting. The singing is also sometimes pitchy, and the mixing is a bit of a mixed bag (though not nearly as bad as people online seem to think), but I still thought it was an impressive project from TV Girl.
