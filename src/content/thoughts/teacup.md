Why was the budget for this show $2? Why did the lady at the start randomly say murder maker out of nowhere? Why did the lady at the start cut her bindings if she just needed to run? Why did they hire someone who had no idea how to film, to film this show? Why do they change camera angles for no reason? Why is there shaky cam on some shots that it really doesn't need to be in? These are all questions I had within the first five or so minutes and if that's not a red flag I don't know what is. I'm not sure if anyone actually watched this show after making it because if they did they likely would have realised just how jarring so many of these scenes are. So jarring in fact that I gave up on this by the end of the first episode which might've not been enough time to fully judge it but I'm not a real reviewer and I don't want to waste my time on dogshit.
