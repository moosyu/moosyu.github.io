A real bore of an album imho. I'd been recommended this by a friend so I kind of felt compelled to listen to the whole album even though I had really kind of stopped enjoying it by about halfway through. 1995 was nice but after a couple more songs I realised everything in this album kind of sounds the same to me and it wasn't super engaging though at the same time it was a pretty comfortable boring. To be fr I actually listened to this album like one time a couple weeks ago so I can't really remember my thoughts on it, I'm just kinda going through my backlog of albums I forgot to log atm, sorry to any Gibbers...
