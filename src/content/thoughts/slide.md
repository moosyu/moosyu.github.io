Super pretty album, not the life changing experience I was advertised by the review that finally got me to check this out but a really consistent, smooth and succinct experience. I do feel like it kind of blew its load a little too early as the first three songs were my favourites by a decent margin and had me blowing my load listening to them but even then there aren't any songs on here I think I could call bad.

I really fuck with the seamless transition between Dumb and Blast Off, it's simple but I feel like stuff like that doesn't get done enough, really helps the album flow, though just this album in general flows super well which is a pretty important thing for me especially for a hypnagogic pop album like this. Like the way Walk Slowly is a slowed reprise of the first song? So awesome dude. Along with that there's a lot of stuff in this album that just had my head bobbing, not too quick, just real chill like and I think it was a really nice change of pace for me. I don't often find myself listening albums that don't make me feel like I'm trapped in some kind of industrial death trap (not that that's a bad thing).

I'll probably be relistening to this at some point, I know I say this a lot and then often forget too however when I heard this album it was late at night and I had just finished LONG SEASON again so that could've made some moments of this album sound weak in comparison. Dunno. Listening to it when I was tired did feel like somewhat of an ethereal experience though so it might have canceled the Fishmans out.

Edit: I'm not quite sure what I was talking about in the first bit, there are so many good songs that are as good as the first three. Monster?? You Lost Me There?? Insane.

Edit 2: 8 -> 9, ohhh my god Monster is so unbelievably good. Like I mean I liked in the first few times but every time I hear it I feel like it just grows on me more and more. Not just Monster though, this entire album is such an earworm and I've been listening to it nearly constantly all week.
