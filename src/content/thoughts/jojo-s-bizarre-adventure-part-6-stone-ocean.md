The first time JoJo actually had a character arc because Jolyne was actually a different person at the end. Pucci wasnt as good as Kira but he was better then part 5s villain and he actually thought he was the good guy which is a shift from the rest of the JoJo villains so far and was an interesting viewpoint and to be honest the heaven plan isn't that bad of a plan.
