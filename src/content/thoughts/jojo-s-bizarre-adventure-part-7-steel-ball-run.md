Cross country grave robbing roadtrip with a consistently interesting story and a feel that is completely different to the other parts (probably because its a reboot but still). Johnny and Gyro's friendship felt very charming and they had so much chemistry despite how wacky they are and it made them a super entertaining duo to watch. Spin is 10000 times better than ripple because it actually makes sense (not really but it could've made less sense) and doesn't put me to sleep and every character, even minor villains have interesting backstories.
