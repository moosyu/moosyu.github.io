Bless the souls of all three people who told me to listen to this after I disliked Perverts. This album is everything I loved about Perverts, a more pop-like vibe without the long droning sections which I found tedious to sit through not to say it was without some of these as it had some moments like that in songs like Ptolemaea but it wasn't quite as drawn out and boring as many in Perverts. This album is absolutely great and I can see exactly where all the hype around Ethel was coming from. 

American Teenager pulled me out of what I was up to and forced me to and provide this album with my complete focus and for its entire hour runtime it was like Ethel had me in a stranglehold. Ethel's voice is wonderful and the recording is on point. Many sections of the narrative on the other hand were interesting but didn't resonate with me personally, not to say for something to resonate you'd have to had experienced it personally but as someone who had a fairly uneventful but happy youth in a atheistic household some lyrics about religion or familial turmoil are so far detached from my own experiences that they're difficult to grasp.

I hope Ethel Cain makes more stuff like this in the future though I'm not quite sure what direction she intends to go in at this point, and after hearing Perverts I won't say my expectations are completely marred but they'll be at least a little toned down for her following projects.
