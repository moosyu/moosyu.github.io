I misread Deafhaven as Deftones somehow so for the first 20 minutes or so I thought I was listening to a completely different artist, my mistake. I also never expected this to be a metal album with that cover, I had assumed I was going to listen to some genre with indie in the name but I suppose not, sadly metal is not my favourite genre at all especially with the screamy, incomprehensible lyrics in this album. I prefer my metal more rock leaning personally. I know with that I mind I really should've never listened to this album, and I'd have agree with you on that one because I didn't enjoy this at all. It was pretty grating and felt like a slog to sit through with nothing really griping me. Had some nice riffs at least.
