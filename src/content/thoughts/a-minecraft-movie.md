Lowkey this deserves way lower than I gave it but I watched it with some friends so it was a lot more funny than it would've been. I'm unsure as to why they decided to make family drama and shit acting as if this was an actual movie, this was just a funny stupid film and it should've stayed as such. I thought it was a little self referential too, it didn't really feel like I was watching a Minecraft movie, more just a stupid ass block film with guys yelling Minecraft words if you get me, not to mention though I expected it based on the trailers, the live action actors look terribly out of place though I think they do a decent job aside from the autistic kids sister having a few bad line deliveries and the black woman being just a stereotypical movie black woman who yells. Seeing my country in the movie was cool too despite them picking the backwater shithole that is Huntley.
