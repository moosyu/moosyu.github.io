I wasn't really enjoying this film for the first thirty odd minutes, I had to listen to Luna talk like someone who just learnt how far too soon, but when my goat Ronald tried to escape the potions class by calling himself a menace I knew we were so back. Mr Potter however, really needs to get his priorities straight. He's hurtling towards a battle with the most evil mf alive apparently and he's tryna get bitches, I've seen more than enough of this in previous films and it is not in anyway scratching the magical itch that makes me watch these films. The floating girl bit was pretty cool though, reminded me of Vecna killing people in stranger things but a little less bone snappy.
