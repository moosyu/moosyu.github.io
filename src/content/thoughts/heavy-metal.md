I actually listened to this quite a while ago but I'm unsure as to where that review ended up though this grew on me so I might as well rewrite it. Heavy Metal by Cameron Winter, lead singer of Geese is a very bizarre and deeply charming folk album that I keep finding myself coming back to. While its got a couple duds that don't feel as interesting or are just a bit much which is why I'm not rating this higher, his unusual method of singing and songwriting are both intriguing while captivating and have me returning to songs like $0 and Cancer of the Skull pretty consistently. While certainly not for everyone, in fact my younger brother despised it when I tried to put him on, I'd at least give him a shot with an open mind and you might find yourself having a good time.
