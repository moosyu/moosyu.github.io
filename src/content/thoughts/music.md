Oops, I thought I already added this one, better late than never though I guess. Honestly this might be my favourite Carti album yet. Despite it being 30 tracks more than half of them are good enough to add to my playlist which is already a hell of a lot better than WLR (though not a great ratio either). Despite all the songs having similar vibes they also manage to feel varied enough for this album to not make you feel like you're going insane in some echoy Carti room like WLR, you can tell POP OUT and CRUSH are from the same album but between CRUSH's grand layered vocals and POP OUT's manic autism they both stand out in their own way which I can say for about half of the album.

By the way, I gotta defend POP OUT for a second because it's probably my favourite song on the album and it gets so much shit :( It's super energetic and a great way to set the mood for the rest of the album, same with MOJO JOJO I don't care that Kendrick and Carti are having gay adlib sex or something it's fun guysss. Swamp Izzo adlibs also aren't as annoying for me as they were on the first listen either, I actual like them on most of the songs except for OPM BABI he can go fuck himself for that one it was so beautiful and Swamp Izzo ruined it.
