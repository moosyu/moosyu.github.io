A pretty great album that kind of started collapsing in on itself midway through but then seemed to hold off the collapse just well enough. The whole first half banged but the second was a little hit or miss for me though 'the CIA', 'commatose' and 'abyss angel' really clutched up and held this together. Especially commatose that song bangs so hard. The first half was incredible though with not a single miss.
