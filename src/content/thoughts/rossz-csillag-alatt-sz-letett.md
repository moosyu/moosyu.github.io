Read hated Szerencestlen but it was smooth sailing from there. Maybe it's because right before I listened to a song from the genre harsh noise wall and needed to cool off idk. I liked the classical moments a fair bit more than I expected and I enjoyed Ongyikos Vasanap and Hajnal (especially Hajnal that was fire) quite a lot and I thought the ending song was very pretty but a fair few of the songs just felt a bit redundant and I'd probably have enjoyed it more if it was a bit shorter but that might just be a skill issue, maybe I'll need a relisten. Some of this album kind of reminded me of Maigre by Igorrr and Ruby My Dear which was cool.
