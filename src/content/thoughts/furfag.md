I'm not a Pent Up Pup fan, though by the cover and the name I totally knew what I was getting into when I started listening and I really wouldn't have listened to this if I hadn't noticed how divisive this album seemed to be. When I last checked this had just as many 100s as it had 0s so I seeing that I had to wonder if this was as bad as people were making it out to be or instead maybe people just saw the cover and gave it a 0 without giving the album a chance.

I thought the production here was very solid or at least unique most of the time, much more so than their previous EP which I heard a couple songs from a little while back. The rest of it though, I'm not so sure about. I thought the vocals were pretty mediocre, I might just be saying that because the guy's British though, not 100% sure and while I appreciate how confident this guy is in his sexuality I still couldn't help but feel uncomfortable sitting through the freaky gay furry sex album sadly so that ended up really putting a damper on how much enjoyment I could pull from this.

The lyrics don't really have any real substance to be found in them, this guy clearly just wanted to make a fun silly project and I'd say he achieved it even if I personally didn't find it all that fun. It'd be pretty silly for me to sit here and trying to read into such wonderful lyrics as 'I guess yiff imitates life' but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have liked it more if there was some meaning behind the songs. Obviously not really the place to be looking for that though of course but a man can dream.

If you're into the genre and don't feel any discomfort hearing about how much Pent Up Pup wants to fuck I'm sure this album will be a really fun time but unfortunately it's not for me. Happy valentines to everyone reading this, it's already over for me and I had a pretty good one, I hope it goes well for you all too and if a good valentines day for you is having a fursuit orgy more power to you.
