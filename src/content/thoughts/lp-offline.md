Had to go on an ebay scavanger hunt for that low quality picture of the back cover. Anyways this album goes insanely hard and HAZARD DUTY PAY! alone makes this better than the online version which was already an incredible album in itself. This is probably the JPEGMAFIA album I end up coming back to most (aside from perhaps the new album right now but that's just because I'm trying to get a feel for it).
