What the fuck is this Joe? Please go back to grooming minors. I know why he reversed it, copyright and shit, but like did he really think anyone who isn't a Tallyhall superfan would put in the effort to download the mp3 and manually reverse this shit. Anyways I listened to some shitty bootleg Soundcloud version of this before realising he made an unreversed version called Joe Hawley. Jokes on me I guess. This isn't really a 1 I just got too pissed off.
