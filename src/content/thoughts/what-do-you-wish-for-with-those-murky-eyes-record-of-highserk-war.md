Interesting story, a pretty unique spin on the whole isekai story with good art and a pretty rad setting (medieval fantasy isn't exactly something I seem to find a lot in manga) tragically held back by the worst translations of all time. I'm unsure as to if I should be rating based on translations but I'm going to regardless. After about chapter 15 or 16 everything goes absolutely batshit and incoherent. Lots of missing pages, missing chapters and I found myself reading English, Spanish and Portuguese (a language that I don't even know so I was just reading the Spanish and English overlapping words) just to get an inkling of whats going on. If I was to just read the English translation I'd have missed out on a fair bit and I still felt like I was going insane regardless. I'm unsure if this was just a ComicK issue or what but regardless I don't have the energy to find out. The first 15 chapters were good though.
