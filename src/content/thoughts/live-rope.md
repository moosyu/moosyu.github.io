It's Christmas day and I'm listening to a Swans album, what the fuck happened to my life? Anyhow the Swans continue to get hyped up on this site and I continue to not know why. They aren't particularly bad or anything but their music is just so god damn boring, the instrumentals especially which is a shame because some of their songs are like full 30 minutes of instrumentals.

Some points in this album are just so unbelievably repetitive it borders on annoying. Like how can the first 7 minutes of Rope just be the same strum with a boring drone in the background and the singer channelling a demon or yodelling or some shit, it feels too simple and empty and it really drags. Even when it started to ramp up and get all over the top and shit (my favourite part of every post-rock album), it feels like Swans overdid it. Maybe it was because the recording I'm listening to is just so horrifically low quality but it just sounds like an endless washed out wall of painful sound.

I'll still listen to their new album when it eventually drops but my expectations have never been lower. Now, time to hype myself up to talk to my racist uncles who I see once a year in a few hours, wish me luck.
