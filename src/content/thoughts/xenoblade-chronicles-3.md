My brother bought this one so you just know I had to invade his home and try it for myself and this shit is so bad. I don't know if it was a translating issue or a voice acting issue (to be honest it's probably both) but this game makes you feel stupid playing it. The dialogue is unintentionally comical and these guys don't shut the fuck up for a single second everything I do I can hear this guy saying shit. Very frustrating experience.
