I can definitely see why this album is regarded so highly in terminally online music rings. The instrumentation is wonderful even if the singing is a little nasally and raw for me and you can really hear the how much influence this had directly or indirectly from Surfjan Stevens to Arcade Fire. The recording does feel a little muffling at some moments I'd have liked some more accordion like the first song (at least I think it's accordion) but I guess it's a folk album so lots of guitar should be expected. The Fool is getting majorly slept on by the way and was probably my favourite track, really felt like it was helping with the already great flow this album had. The heavy mic clipping drums on songs like Holland, 1945 are also pretty sick too and something I want to see more of in modern music, even felt a little reminiscent of Deathconsciousness.

Edit: 8 -> 7, none of the songs really stuck with me.
