Never caught my attention in its entire one hour, it was just more like background noise or something. I don't know why people love this so much, maybe I'll need to relisten at some point.

4.5 -> 7.5, sorry I don't think I really gave this record a chance when I first heard it but I decided to listen to it again after really enjoying Phil's newest project Night Palace recently. Based on what I've heard from Phil, being Night Palace and A Crow Looked at Me, it often feels a lot more like Phil is a poet than a musician. For this reason I've never really felt like listening to his music in album form has done as much for me as it has for other people. A Crow Looked at Me especially, but Night Palace too had moments that just felt like words spoken to instrumentals without much connection between the two. The Glow, Pt. 2, on the other hand feels a lot more in sync with the music aspect of it so it's easier to digest as an album without losing the very human feel of Phil's music (though that might be my way of saying shit recording quality, not that I particularly mind) or his beautiful songwriting. The instrumentals also felt very intimate and personal on this record like Phil was in the room with me or something. Despite this, I'm scoring slightly lower than Night Palace as I think Phil's songwriting there was a lot more interesting and engaging for me to dig into, making Night Palace feel more replayable. I also found the subject matter of Night Palace more interesting.
