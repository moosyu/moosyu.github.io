I was kinda sceptical because to be honest I don't think anybody was asking for this and I generally didn't like the fionna and cake episodes because they felt like filler but this most certainly was not filler. The art was great and I get to have yet another look at the world of Adventure Time, there was yet again not a single miss in the entire season and while I don't think it ever reached the peak the Distant Lands did in together again that's kind of a hard target. Also I got to see Prismo again (my beloved)
