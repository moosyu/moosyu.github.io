Another one that may be a reupload but I can't for the life of me find the old review... 

 Even in terms of manhwa, the shitty inbred cousin of manga, this is unreadable trash unless you're the kind of person who wears fingerless gloves because you think they make you look cool. 

 Getting started with my only non-negative aspect being that the art looks all right; it's not good, but it's pretty decent for manhwa standards. Sadly for any people who just like looking at pictures, I hear that the art gets worse after the break between seasons one and two, though I wouldn't know because even 20 chapters was too much for me to stomach. 

 The backstory is decently interesting. The front story, on the other hand, is extremely generic. The guy is OP because the author wants the 12 year olds to be able to use him as a self insert to pretend they aren't losers. The author tries to get you invested in the main character so he can do his edgy bullshit, but the bullying is comical more than anything. I've both never been bullied and don't live in Korea, so for all I know it could be a shithole but I have eyes and have seen bullying, both physical and mental, and unless the people bullying you are fucking stupid, they aren't going to do it the way the main character is shown being bullied here. 

 The dialogue is just bad, the characters are shallow, and the protagonist is too busy being covered in blood and making his eyes red and shit for me to be able to care about him. I highly doubt the author did any work on the dialogue and I don't blame him because the audience he is trying to get by writing this probably doesn't care about it nor has the reading comprehension above a third grade level to even tell the difference between this and well written dialogue. I could probably say the same thing about the actual story too. 

 Only read this if you are really starved for content, but if you're in that situation just go outside instead.
