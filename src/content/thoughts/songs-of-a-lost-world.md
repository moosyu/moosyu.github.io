Listened with my Dad and him being pissed off that the songs were all like 6 minutes honestly made the experience way better. I was already impressed with 'Alone', but when 'And Nothing Is Forever' went on, holy shit I was going crazy. One of the best songs I've heard this year. The only low point on this one for me was Warsong and it was barely a low point. We are back team.

Edit: 8.8 -> 8.4 This album has grown off me a little. I still think it's great but it's not hitting as hard.

 Edit 2: 8.4 -> 7.5, find myself not wanting to return to this album as often as an 8 should have me.
