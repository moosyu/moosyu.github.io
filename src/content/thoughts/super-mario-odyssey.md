I cannot fathom the reason my brother spent almost $100 on this. Edit: I have come to the conclusion that I don't hate Mario Odyssey I just hate the Switch. This little piece of shit is uncomfortable no matter what I do I hate this stupid ass thing. It's either hurting my hand, my neck or my heart 💔. I also just hate moving the Mario camera give me a mouse please god.
