I'm not gonna come out and say this is a good movie but I did enjoy watching it. It's nice every once in a while to watch a 2000s romance slop movie. You can really tell this is around the point where they started running out of ideas for romcoms because this is a pretty batshit premise but it's cute and often pretty funny too which is quite the accomplishment for any romcom. There weren't any laugh out loud moments here but there were a good few loud exhales and it was able to keep my attention for an hour thirty. What more does a person need? I will say there were some more darker moments that I wasn't sure if were done that way on purpose or not. Like there was one or two scenes where the character is having like a mental break and it's played for laughs and while it was a bizarre choice I'm not sure I totally hate it.
