Sorry about how fucked up the cookies are in the picture by the way. One of my mitts had a hole, and I didn't realise until I went to take these out of the oven and was burnt and basically threw them onto the counter, which destroyed a few of them. Anyways, YouTube Shorts kind of hounded me into making these, and since I love peanut butter, I thought there couldn't be any harm (aside from to my heart because I had to use half a block of butter). The video I saw had chocolate chips in the cookies, but I ran out of chocolate chips like a year ago and never bought more. I considered just adding chocolate chunks but decided against it; the peanut butter is the main part anyway, even if peanuts and dark chocolate are a good combo. John unfortunately heavily overestimated how good of a chef I was because despite this recipe being extremely simple, I somehow fought with this stuff for 40 minutes and had to do most of it by hand because my electric whisk is useless. This guy also said to bake the cookies for "about eight minutes" and I cannot possibly see how that's correct. I cooked them for eight, and they looked super undercooked, so I did them for another two, and even then they didn't look cooked enough. Unfortunately by that point I was scared I'd take them out and the bottoms would be black or something, and I'd have wasted 40 minutes, so I cracked under the pressure. I think they could easily be put in for 12 minutes because after ten minutes they still lacked any kind of crunch. I did kind of half-arse this recipe, but I think I added roughly the right amount of stuff, so I just can't see how this was meant to be done in eight minutes. My oven was even set above 350°F because I round up when I convert to Celsius. I'll probably make this again because aside from texture, they tasted really good (though that tends to happen when you add as much butter and sugar as I did to anything), and I'll give an update on if I was really meant to cook these more or was just stupid.
