Hmmm, auspicious. This might need a few more listens for me to get it fully and probably some more focus on the lyrics as I definitely felt like I wasn't getting the full picture at some points, though with its relatively short 36 minute length I imagine I'll be listening to it again sooner rather than later. Even without a deep understanding of the album during my first listen it was still kind of great?? I'm not really one for chamber music or folk so I don't really know how this weighs up in comparison to any other albums but this album certainly had me almost transfixed at some points, only being broken out of the immersion by track five and six which while not bad at all just seem to have a different vibe or something? I don't know, cant explain it. Overall some great stuff and I think I'll need to listen to some more Laura Marling in the future. Edit: 8.1 -> 6, really grew off me for some reason, just bores me a little now.
