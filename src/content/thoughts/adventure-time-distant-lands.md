type: TV Show
score: 8.5

Adventure Time comes back again to tell more interesting stories and further flesh out one of my favourite worlds with even been animation then the original. Not a single episode was a miss even though wizard city really should have been episode 3 and together again should have been episode 4. Assuming together again was the intended conclusion Adventure Time sticks the landing for the second time with an ever better ending then the actual show and I cried like a little baby.
