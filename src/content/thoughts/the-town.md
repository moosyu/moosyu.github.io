Just another dumb fun action movie. I'd have liked to see more of Doug and Claire's relationship because it felt a little rushed though I guess it only had two and a half hours. I also couldn't stop thinking of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and that shit really took me out of it but that might just be a personal failing.
