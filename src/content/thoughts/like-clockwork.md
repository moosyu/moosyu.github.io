Rock without any bonus flavours or over the top zesty production has never been a genre I really enjoyed, despite that I think I had a good time with this record. I Appear Missing is really great and my favourite on this by far.

Edit: 7 -> 5, what did I mean by zesty production? Anyways this albums songs feel bland on relisten.
