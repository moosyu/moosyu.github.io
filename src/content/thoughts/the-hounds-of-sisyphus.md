Early days but it's alright. Can't remember the names of the two MC's so I'll just be calling them big guy and little guy. The art isn't super special but the characters look pretty charming (if a little at sleepy at all times for some reason) though I'd like it if the backgrounds weren't so bad, guess it's hard to work on a weekly schedule for manhwa though so I get it. I'm a little confused with why big guy is like half black though. I appreciate the romance being pretty fast paced too though it does get a little rapey it parts I can't lie. Both characters seem pretty generic too, pretty cookie cutter strong stupid guy and smart weak guy, I wish they'd do a little more to not seem like stereotypes. The zombie apocalypse plot could've been more prominent I reckon, just feels like it's being used to shove these too guys together and not really been elaborated on, feels like all danger disappears almost instantly. One last thing, didn't expect to see full blown cock at all, even less in like 20 chapters but I guess here we are and holy shit big guy really is a big guy it's like half of little guy's chest he's gonna die 😭.
