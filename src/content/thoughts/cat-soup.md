Honestly this was really disturbing, it made me feel mad uncomfortable and the humour didn't hit for me but I couldn't look away either. The kids are really mean too :(. To be honest I could only read the first two volumes as the English translation seems to be missing for the rest, but I think I got an idea of it and I don't think I could read any more to be honest. Still I feel like being disturbing was its point so I'm gonna give it a 5 due to being impressed by how well it pulls it off.
