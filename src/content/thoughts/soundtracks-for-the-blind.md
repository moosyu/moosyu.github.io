Overrated piece of dog shit. The first three songs were the best in the entire album and only song I enjoyed on copper was the sound. I cant believe I wasted 2 hours of my life listening to this with the assumption that it would get better and it being called a masterpiece would start to make sense. I couldn't even tell this album's songs apart because they all sound the same and the whispering vocals made me feel like I was going senile.
