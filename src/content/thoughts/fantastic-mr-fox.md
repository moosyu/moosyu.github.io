I didn't blink for this entire film. The animation is so beautiful and the characters as well as the story are super charming. \n

Edit: Felt like I should say a little more though I haven't watched the film in a year or so, maybe just take what I say with a grain of salt (which you should really be doing already). Fantastic Mr. Fox is a jaw-droppingly beautiful film with its stop motion and unique aesthetic which make it something I doubt we'll ever see again. The way you can almost feel the amount of effort put into every frame makes watching this film worthwhile to check out. Aside from that though the story, while rather simple is very human despite the characters being foxes. That scene where Mr Fox talks about not wanting to live in a hole anymore, aside from just being a brilliantly shot scene with that single viewpoint of Mr Fox reading the paper, really made me really feel for Mr Fox. His concerns felt very real and considering animals in the film live their proper animal lifespans I can understand his urgency, that detail also makes it make sense why everyone's darting around and shit aside from it being funny to watch and making stop motion easier. These guys are going to live for like seven years, got to make the most out of it (even if it ends up fucking everything up and making Mr Fox come to the realisation that he is quite a lot more domesticated than he thought). Love this film.
