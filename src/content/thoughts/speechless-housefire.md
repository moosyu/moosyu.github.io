Pretty impressive album for a guy with 65 monthly listeners but it had some pretty ehh moments holding it back aswell as just not being super great at holding my attention, any longer and I might've given up on it. Songs like Pavlova Moon which had a pretty dogshit chorus and Conflict Of Opinion which somehow had a mic many levels worse than the rest of the album which weren't helping the situation. The rest of it was pretty fine, I even added Airport and Papercut King to my playlist.
