type: Manhwa
score: 3

The backgrounds suck ass and use a lot of the generic placeholder assets you see in other manhwa, the posing of the characters are almost always stilted and hair colour is just about as far as character designs go. The characters themselves are pretty generic and boring, strong MC and group of strong quirky friend like angry sword woman, big strong man, they even have a knockoff Pram. I'm not even sure how strong the MC is because he was somehow able to kill a like god in his last life that killed like tens of thousands and then you mean to tell me that he can't use an apparently basic part of swordsmanship? The story is about as generic as it gets too, evil cult wants to destroy the world so MC has to get strong and kill them, not to mention its regression so it couldn't possibly be interesting in the first place when you already know the destination, truly the isekai of manhwa. 

 I first heard of this because it was popular on r/manhwa a few months ago which was already a real flag and then found out it was popular on ComicK too so I went in already knowing it was going to be shit, lo and behold it was. I know it's bad to come in with already negative expectations of something but if this manhwa was actually good it'd be able to change my expectations so I don't want to hear any shit. Academy's Genius Swordmaster's real saving grace is that it's so nothing that it can't possibly offend me enough for it to be rated lower than a 3.
