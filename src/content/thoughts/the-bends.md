Was a little scared to listen to this because of all the freaky sex jokes made about it but it had an extremely solid first half, on par with OK Computer with a still solid if a bit weaker second. You can certainly tell this was made before Radiohead was fully standing on solid ground and there were still some growing pains but despite that it holds up shockingly well against the test of time and is a massive step in the right direction after Pablo Honey.

Edit: 7.5 -> 8.5, I'm sorry but this album fucking bangs.
