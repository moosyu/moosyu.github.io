I got this one recommended to me by a friend and I think its worn off me. I originally thought it was maybe a 7.5 but the more times I hear the songs the less interesting they sound. Circus Maximus, My Eyes, Looove and Modern Jam are really good but the rest is kind of weak at least for Travis Scott standards. This could have done without a fair few of the songs.
