If Naver doesnt pick this up I'm selling my organs so I can. 

 Edit: 8 -> 6, Not as good as I remember, fine with this just beeing a three chapter thing. 

 Edit 2: 6 -> 2, Okay so it seems this was actually picked up and after catching up its even worse than I thought it was sadly. The best aspect of this was the art, even if most character designs aren't super interesting the art for the MC and the monsters is always super cool to look at as well as the huge attacks. I just wish it had a little less edge, the MC cannot catch a break and while it felt alright for a three chapter series just to set it up, when every chapter or two it tells us how much pain he's in or introduces best friends we've never heard of just to kill them off, it feels like a bit much. Aside from the MC being tortured it's a pretty generic gate Manhwa so it gets boring fairly quickly especially when it collapses in on it self about 15 chapters in. I don't know if the author got told he could only make like 40 chapters or something but the pace becomes completely fucked and it gets extremely confusing with random retcons and shit going on. 

 Edit 3: I might be going completely schizo so I won't update the score just yet but I think I see a very bizarre vision for this manhwa and I think maybe we're going somewhere. Is this writing fire?
