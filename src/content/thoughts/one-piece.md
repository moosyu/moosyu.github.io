Honestly the more One Piece I read the more just fatigued I feel. I just can't love a series that has no stakes, nobody ever dies and I know death isn't the only way to build stakes but One Piece is the kind of story where death should happen, its a bunch of pirates shooting at each other in a sea where if the MC falls in he dies and it feels like Oda pulling it out his ass when somehow everyone survives. How am I meant to care about massive fights when I know the characters could just wait a week after then do it again. I still think One Piece is a good manga but I don't think its as great as I first thought when I had only read 100 chapters.
