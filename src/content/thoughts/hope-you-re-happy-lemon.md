Had to drop this one honestly. The art is good and the freaky friday plot would've been pretty alright except the circumstances for the MC and Lemon's breakup were pretty fucked and honestly it doesn't really matter to me that she didn't actually cheat on him with a bunch of other guys. He thinks that what happened and yet Lemon when she first meets him again doesn't even apologise, she just acts like nothing happened and it got me all pissed off. I don't appreciate the author trying to pull these two together, it feels unnatural and it's pretty clear Lemon hasn't grown all that much because if she had she'd probably had apologised off the bat or at least in the first few chapters. Just reading this manga makes me feel angry and pissed off so I don't imagine I'll be returning, I'm fairly sure nothing the author can do would redeem Lemon as a character which sucks because she takes up like 40% of the screen time for this manga.
