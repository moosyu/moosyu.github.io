Yowch, that's gonna leave a mark. This album was so boring it took me four weeks to finish a 49 minute long album. The best songs on here were 'TIME MOVING SLOW', 'PROMOTION' and '530' and one of them is an old song he released with no changes and the other two I just have to pretend I cant hear the lyrics. Reach for the popcorn, oops thats my cock was the best part of the album though.

Edit: Fuck he added a shitty ai verse to 530 bruh.
