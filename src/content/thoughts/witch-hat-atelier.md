Witch Hat Atelier has absolutely awesome art and has a unique-enough take on a Western (ish) magic story, both are things I love so it was a bit of a shock that I didn't completely love this manga. Obviously it wasn't terrible or even bad but it's a bit disappointing that a manga with such huge potential has been squandered due to some pretty awful pacing. Up until ~chapter 50 this was basically a pretty boring slice of life and then it finally decides to pick up the pace but by that point any momentum it had was already lost and Witch Hat Atelier really struggled to regain it. I'm happy to say however that Witch Hat Atelier is currently in the best state it has ever been in and if the current quality continues I'm sure its score will start to rise. If you're willing to sit through some tedium (or you just like slice of life) I'd definitely give this manga a shot.
