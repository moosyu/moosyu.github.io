I'm on my Quentin Tarantino grind it seems. I wanted to watch a more "recent" (as recent as 2009 is I guess) film by Tarantino but Django was like three hours long (saying that I didn't realise Inglorious Bastards was almost three as well). Inglorious Bastards is shot beautifully from setting to cinematography and definitely gets the most out of its 2009 cameras, I can hardly believe Final Destination was released the same year, it's impressive just how well Inglorious Bastards has held up in comparison.

The first scene of this movie is so fuckin good, the tension it builds and then holds for almost twenty minutes has me tingling, it has me gulping and shit. The way the camera moves down to reveal the Jews, the way that Landa and Perrier stare at each other is so great and the way the music builds until it's practically blasting out your eardrums is just so peak. Incredible intro sequence and really sets the mood.

It's not just the intro sequence that builds tension so well though though, the build up for the reveal of the "bear jew" just for him to abruptly kill off the soldier so suddenly, so peak. Kind of made me feel bad for the soldier for a second there. I also really like how in some scene when you're viewing from the point of view of a character who doesn't know a language, the conversation isn't subtitled, I know this isn't an uncommon thing to do but it makes me feel more connected with the characters by being just as confused as they are.

I'd talk more about this film but I fear I'd spoil it like I was. I'm stupid and checked the wiki to figure out names mid-film, accidentally reading what happens to Zoller in the end while I was still only on the 3rd chapter in the process. My main complaint about this one was that it was just too uncomfortable and tense at times for my taste, kind of made some scenes tough watches especially that one dinner scene, but when Landa shows up and the drums start up, holy fuck, really makes the scene for me. Especially how the drums just stop when it pans over to Goebbels telling a joke, too peak. Landa is such a good character dude it's insane, Waltz absolutely deserved that Oscar, he really made the character and carried the scenes he was in. It'd also be nice if this film was a little shorter, but in the same vein I doubt its story and the way Tarantino told it could've been shortened all that much. I might've just picked an inopportune time to watch it as I got interrupted a few times so its flow got lost a little for me.
