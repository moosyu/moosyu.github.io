Didn't know what I was to expect from this one but it was an unexpectedly fun punk album (I think, I'm still not 100% sure if I know what punk is). Never listened to Viagra Boys before (great name by the way) so I'm not sure if this is the norm for them but the lyrics were funny in a strangely terminally online kind of way which I didn't expect, with such beautiful lines as 'I'm up all night gooning to a picture of you' and 'I'm subscribed to your mom's OnlyFans'. Straight bars. The music itself was energetic, upbeat and just a good time with every song being varied enough to get something different out of most of them. River King was an unexpectedly sombre final song and a pretty emotional performance from the lead singer which I quite liked and might've even made the album for me. Same vibes as Sound Of Silver ending with New York, I Love You But You're Brining Me Down (though NYILYBYBMD still cleans).
