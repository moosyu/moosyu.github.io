Tyler came back with his most hiphop album in ages just to flex or something idk. He's my goat tho and this is probably my most listened to Tyler album to be honest, probably my most listened to album just in general aside from maybe CHASER.

Edit: 9.5 -> 10, THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOAT!! THE GOAT!! I just find myself coming back again and again to this album, I simply cannot stop.
