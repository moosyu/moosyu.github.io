I usually don't buy bad games, sadly I thought I could handle the combat and thought the textures weren't too bad. Guess I was wrong, the combat is straight up atrocious, I know its a product of its time but it feels more like a product of the 1950s. It crashes constantly and sometimes when you tab out the whole right monitor goes black until you close it on task manager. Also the movement sucks ass. Nightmarish experience that doesn't hold up at all.
