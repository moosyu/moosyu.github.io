Liked it less than phoria, felt the first half was extremely weak but I was pleasantly surprised by the last two especially 'Home' which imo is the best song Ace of Spades has ever made, held back by the vocals. Tbh the vocals are easily the worst part of this project and don't mesh well at all with the often good instrumentals.
