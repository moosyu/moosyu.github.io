Very very charming. It's not quite as funny as the authors previous Webtoon Love Advice From The Great Duke of Hell (just yet) I'm pretty optimistic. The art, while not having changed drastically from their previous work is very expressive and helps with a lot of the punchlines, an over exaggerated reaction face helping an already funny joke should be how it's done, GTE could learn a thing from this one. The comedy seems to lean a lot more cringy funny if you get what I mean than the authors last work, but I don't really mind especially when the two MC's awkward ass relationship is such an enjoyable aspect, got me giggling and shit its fucked up. Despite the main concept (vampire dating vampire hunter) feeling pretty cliche this Webtoon feels like every turn it takes is the last thing you'd ever expect and it works every time. Genuinely cannot wait for more of this to come out, probably should've waited for more than 28 chapters to release before starting to read it though.

Edit: 7.5 -> 8.5, you know what, when you're refreshing your Webtoon app waiting for something every Thursday I think it deserves at least an 8 (writing this after the first season has ended). I still don't think its as funny as Love Advice From The Great Duke of Hell and I doubt it ever will be because the author has clearly focused a lot more on making the main story flow properly and now I'm invested for a lot more than just jokes.
