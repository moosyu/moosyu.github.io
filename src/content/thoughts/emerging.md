The disease really need to be developed on more, like how the fuck did they make the choice not to explore the most interesting part of this manga? The ending feels out of nowhere and leads me to believe this must have gotten canceled and the author had to make an ending in a few episodes. I also really don't like the old looking artstyle, doesn't do it for me.
