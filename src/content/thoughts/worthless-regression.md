They wasted so many panels on ass. 

 Edit: I wish I wrote more coherent reviews but past me was onto something, they do get their mileage out of Wiji's ass as well as comically large tits any chance they can get which is sometimes a bit much. Shit had me flabbergasted. Aside from that the art is pretty 'unique' if you can call it that. It looks pretty weird and the colours also just feel a little off, I'm unsure if that was a stylistic choice or just the way the artist likes to draw but it's a little bizarre regardless. The story was alright, I thought some moments felt like the author was pushing a little too far out of his capabilities but at least the author was trying which is something you can't say for a lot of manhwa. The main character's growth is pretty satisfying to watch and I find myself coming back to this every once in a while.
