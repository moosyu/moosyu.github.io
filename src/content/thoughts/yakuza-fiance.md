I really felt something at the start kind of like Bastard where shes trapped and can't escape but they really fumbled, or maybe this what they were going for, but I don't know why you would make a decent story instead of a great one. 

 Edit: Idk what happened but it fw the story now, I still think her being trapped could have been better but this is pretty fire too.
