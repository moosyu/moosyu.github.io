Was honestly a bit scared because I'd heard how bizarre and over the top Frank's music was but despite my 6.5 score I was pretty happily surprised to find this to be an alright jazz rock album. Uncle Remus is clearly the best here but the rest is pretty nice too even if I didn't find the comedy aspects very funny.
