Maybe I just don't get it but the whole first 10 or so minutes felt like just a continuous and painful stream of sounds which was pretty disorienting, if that was the point and if so good job. After that though I started enjoying it more, it started sounding kind of mystical and ethereal which was a nice recovery period for my blown out ear drums though 'a desire part 1' went on a bit too long. In general I also think this album sounded perhaps a little uncoordinated too, though I'm no music reviewer so maybe that was me missing the point again lol. I think my favourite songs were 'untitled-++++++ (or sorrow / intermission)'and 'untitled-+++++++++ (or nothing, version d / forgo)' (especially the latter). That song went hard and pulled this thing up like a full point.
