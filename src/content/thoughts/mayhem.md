Despite having retread a lot of ground that The Fame Monster walked over 15 years ago, hell Vanish Into You is basically a Bad Romance reskin, MAYHEM ended up just being a really good album. I enjoyed all the songs, I like how she got a little Bowie on Killah and I was just overall impressed that Gaga still had it in her to make an album this fun and catchy. Disease > Die With A Smile btw.
