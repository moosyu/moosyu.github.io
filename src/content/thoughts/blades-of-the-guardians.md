Just really fun, found myself forced to read the next chapter because it was just so entertaining and everything felt pretty new to me (maybe I just havent read enough manhua). Only issue is updates are really slow and translations are even slower so I had to do it myself and I'm stupid so I'm not very good at it. 

 Edit: jk it was too hard.
