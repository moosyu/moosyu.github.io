Great bang for your buck and the game actually respects your time. No subscription makes me feel like I can just fuck around without feeling like I'm burning money as I do in other MMOs. Not quite sure how much I like the direction the game is going with recent expansions but I guess that's for future me to be annoyed about.

Edit: It's future me! I've finally got back into Guild Wars 2 and it's just as I remember for better or worse. Firstly, the new expansions are pretty mediocre (not that I had high hopes for the story) to be honest but the weapons are pretty cool, especially the new spears in JW. There are less bosses than I'd have expected which was a bit disappointing but Cerus is really cool even if I'm too trash to do him in challenge mode. Now to talk about some issues with this game I'd left out of my original comment. This game is like really easy, there are challenge motes that up the anti a fair bit but I'd have had liked if there was some of that challenge in the open world because what's even the point of level-scaling if the enemies still don't do damage to me. It makes early game a slog especially because that's probably the point in the game where you'd be doing the least banding together with other people which is the most fun part of GW2. I also have to take a minute to complain about the Living World DLCs because they're sick as hell (especially episode 4) but for some reason they decided to not be normal and force me to buy them via the in game shop and either in a bundle or one by one and like who is buying these one by one. It's so bizarre to me. Anyway sorry for shitting on GW2 so much, do bear in mind I consider it a 9.5 still I just like complaining a lot more than I do complimenting things because complaining is very easy.
