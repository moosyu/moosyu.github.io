Some pretty low tier Twitter gooner bait. Everything about this is very meh however luckily every chapter takes ~3 seconds (as with how predictable it is you really only need to read like 60% of the words to get the full picture) to read so I managed to finish this in about five minutes, which means I can tell you with absolute certainty it doesn't get better despite what the review I read seemed to believe. Even the plot twist that the girl was secretly part of the Yakuza did nothing for me because she was just a such a nothing character...
