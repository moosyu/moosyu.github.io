A very impressive synthpop project, why is the cover undertale fanart though? I think my main problem with this one is that its just too long, everything but The Demon, Lit Fuse, [...] and The Angel could have been cut out. Not to say those songs are bad, in fact I really like all of them (except for Redeyes that song really is bad) but [...] and The Angel alone are an hour 15 minutes and I generally prefer shorter albums. Maybe they could have been put in an extra EP or something. The thing that ruined Redeyes for me was its really piercing noise playing over the like whole second half that of ruined the flow after a very good start with The Demon. I know I really only said bad things about this album I actually did have a good time with this one and it deserves to be more popular than it is. Go listen to this or at least listen to The Angel Pt. 1, that was majestic.
