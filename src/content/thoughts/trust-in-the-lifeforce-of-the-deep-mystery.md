Didn't except this to be completely without vocals but fuck it we ball. This album was mystical at times and tracks 2 through 4 are some of my favourite in the jazz fusion subgenre. I feel like I'd enjoy this more as an EP or just a shorter album though even if it's already not super long at only 45 minutes. The latter half just felt weak.
