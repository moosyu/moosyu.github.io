This is 100% murim slop but it was cool seeing shaolin more as it's always seemed pretty cool in other murim manhwa but never seems to be the focus, however there's way more focus on martial arts than anything else which I expected, but I would've appreciated some more focus on other aspects of being a monk. I also wasn't a huge fan of how quick these monks were to switch up on there beliefs, just felt like a disingenuous portrayal. The art is pretty alright and the characters are pretty badly done, not really a single interesting one except the old monk guy, however despite this all that little chapter about the MC's grandad genuinely made me cry and I cannot for the life of me figure out how this happened. Such a tear jerker for no reason it's fucking me up, real punch to the heart. Apart from that one moment the story is pretty generic though, however a 5.5 seems just about right considering the circumstances.
