I'm unsure why people keep titling their manga like this because no this guy doesn't want a normal life... If he did he'd have just ran away, he had the power to do that like near instantly. Aside from poor naming though I found that this was alright, the story is pretty nothing but it's murim which is unfortunately my favourite genre and had some pretty heartfelt moments for random murim slop. The art wasn't exactly the norm but it was expressive and didn't feel lazy. The backgrounds have the generic assets that I've complained about before but it's easier to forgive here as it doesn't stand out as much and there are sometimes some hand-drawn assets mixed in.
