I've been this series #1 opp for a little while now but didn't put it here bc I thought I already did lol. Anyways this manga/anime is kind of like I'm The Fated Villain in the way that the mc is an irredeemable pos that's impossible to root for. I gave this +0.1 though because he hasn't raped anyone (I think). The manga is also worse pedophile wise (or better if you are a pedo) than the anime. I know this is really popular and my only thought for a reason why is that anime fans are all pedophiles anyways so they don't care.
