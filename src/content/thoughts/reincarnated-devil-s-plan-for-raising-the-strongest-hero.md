Pretty decent start but it goes downhill fast. The characters are far too uninteresting for main characters, contrary to popular belief tragic backstories isn't always enough to make me care about a character and neither the actual story or worldbuilding diverges enough from the usual OP MC isekai slop to carve out its own place in the very oversaturated genre. If you're looking for something similar to this just read SpyXFamily, it's better in every aspect.
