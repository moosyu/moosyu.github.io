The first song didn't click but it was smooth sailing from there, this is honestly one of the 'smoothest' (probably the wrong word) albums I've ever listened to so I can imagine myself returning often especially with all the great songs on here like the title track and Maria La Cuarandera. My only issue is that some songs weren't particularly memorable but that might be a language barrier thing.
