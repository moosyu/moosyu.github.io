The last Pink Floyd record in their legendary 70s run and its... underwhelming?? This album isn't bad, I actually like it but it's just a bit overhyped. It has too many songs and has spread itself thin creatively which you can definitely notice in the second disk where songs start being really hit or miss. Of course Another Brick in the Wall (all parts) and Comfortably Numb are classics though. This is the Donda of the Pink Floyd discography (I cant go a single minute without a Kanye reference sorry).
