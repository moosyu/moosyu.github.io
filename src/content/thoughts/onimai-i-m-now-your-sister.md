A very bizarre mix of self improvement and cgdct. Unfortunately while that is perhaps a mixture of ideas that might just end up being an entertaining read it's main genres are comedy and slice of life so there was no chance I was ever going to enjoy this. I've been forced to realise over and over that the Japanese are not funny people and their attempts always end in complete failure. Not a single joke in the entire 96 chapters I read was even funny enough to make me even exhale air. This was mainly because all the jokes are the same joke, Mahiro is in a normal situation and is too much of a shut-in to act normal and freaks the fuck out. It wasn't funny the first time and it certainly wasn't funny the 96th time. The joke about Mahiro getting hard because a little girl touched him landed especially poorly and made me want to blow my brains out and it's a little unnerving to see this character who was meet to be some grown ass man act like a little anime girl maybe that's just me though. I also don't really like how this sketchy man is befriending little girls. The only things I can give it credit for is that the art is pretty alright and that the self improvement throughline is mildly interesting.
