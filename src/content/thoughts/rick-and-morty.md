Morty I've been sending unsolicited messages to underaged girls Morty, I love little girls. Morty I fucking love them. They make me feel young and powerful. There's nothing in the world that compares to that. That's what all these rich folk in hollywood and senate are doing. That's why they killed Epstien Morty. And now they're going to lock me up for good.

Edit: this is a quote from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScXLZqkc3Fw. I swear I haven't lost it. Also I just gotta say season 8 is so ass.
