I like the crocodile. Aside from that the art is some of the worst in the manhwa industry up until ~volume 3 (435 chapters in) and even then it still looks trash, I imagine it will be about that of an average manhwa average by chapter 700 (not a joke a real prediction). The story is above average though but never really kept me too hooked and I'm not too big a fan of the chapter long explainations of each floor though tbh I couldn't think of a better way to do it.
