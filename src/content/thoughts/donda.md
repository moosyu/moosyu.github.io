I think Kanye must have given me PTSD or something after Vultures because even going back to this project which I thought was a dogshit mess on my first few listens I now think is kind of great. It's still a real mess in terms of quality but I think it's highs are too high for me to disregard. This album has many of Kanye's best imho. I've even grown on some songs like Junya and Jonah which I originally thought killed the flow of the album. I imagine I'll come back to this album again and again after Kanye continues to ruin my life with dogshit. Edit: 7.5 -> 9, god blessed my soul and now I like every song on this album. I feel like that horse running through a field majestically.
