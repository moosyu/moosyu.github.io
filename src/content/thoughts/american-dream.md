type: Album
score: 8.5

No it's not the worst LCD Soundsystem album. It's a step down for sure but it still has the same LCD Soundsystem charm and oh baby is easily one of their best. The main issue with this album was some really disappointing last few songs, there did not need to be any 12 minute songs and the rest of the stuff was good but it just didnt blow me away like those on Sound Of Silver or This Is Happening.

Edit: 7.5 -> 9, I can't explain myself and I won't apologise for my beliefs.

Edit: 9 -> 8.5, this grew off me a little after relistening to Sound of Silver. This certainly doesn't match up to Sound Of Silvers heights nor even the heights of the long goodbye. Regardless american dream is still a great record.
