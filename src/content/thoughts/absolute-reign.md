Kind of a needle in a haystack find as far as murim slop goes. I remember maybe a month ago complaining there wasn't enough well drawn murim slop and this is exactly what I wanted, while the art is sometimes spotty, when it needs to be it can also become fuckin insane. If you take a glance at the image I displayed, like holy shit how they do that, this manhwa is definitely using the longstrip format of manhwa to its advantage in panels like this and it's awesome especially when so many just don't bother leveraging the unique medium they're using. 

 Aside from that, while the story isn't anything super special, even in writing this I can barely remember if there's a primary motivation or if they're just dicking around, but there are some aspects that keep me engaged in the scenes that aren't fights. The mystery of who the male MC is which is being unraveled in the recent chapters is captivating and his playful personality doesn't make him come off as an annoying cunt like a few other MCs in similar stories I've read do. I like the female MC too which is quite the surprise considering how shounen manhwa usually are, while she's a bit too naïve at times (like I know she probably grew up sheltered but surely she can't be blind), her willingness for growth and change is endearing and a big part of why I'm so interested in this. It'd be nice if she depended on the male MC less but I suppose at the pace she's growing she won't be for long. I'm enjoying the slowburn romance too, though I do wish it'd burn a bit quicker as I don't think I can wait 200 chapters for any proper development that isn't just teasing. Delicious slop regardless.
