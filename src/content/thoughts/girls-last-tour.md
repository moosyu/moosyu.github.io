Edit: After [Josh brutalized Girls' Last Tour in his blog post about it](https://joo.sh/journal/girls-last-tour_2026-02-07-T212428), I finally attained the energy to write something more than a sentence long about it, now I'm up to write two. His was about the anime though and this is about the manga so we can both be right. I really liked the way GLT used its slice of life format to lull you into a false sense of security. The lead's charming chemistry, the lovely art and the interesting world allow you to get invested only for the comforting vibe to be torn away in the final chapter. It's beautiful but it's also so tragic, reading it made me physically feel ill and after reading it I was so upset that I failed any I.T. assignment I was supposed to turn in the following day. I've been told by some (stupid (tm)) people that it's actually a happy ending because it's the best case scenario for them but I fail to understand what's happy about dying. It's an awful fate and it's for that reason that I think the ending resonated with me so much. You might've noticed, but I've really only talked about it and that's because I'm writing this multiple years after reading the manga and yet I remember how the ending made me feel so vividly. I can't imagine myself ever going back to this manga but I also can't imagine ever forgetting this manga, it's brilliant and one of the best to ever do it.
