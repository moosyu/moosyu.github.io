At its best it's a slightly above average gang manhwa. It has a lot of issues but I'd rather talk about the least important one, why does the artist draw the girls in a pornhwa artstyle?? Not to say I'm gay its just that I'm not attracted to the weird ass pornhwa proportions, like if you look for more then a second everything goes to shit, their cardboard personalities don't help either though that isn't specific to the girls, the guys are paper thin too. Though this didn't seem like a problem for the average reader as from the comments most people who read this are 13.
