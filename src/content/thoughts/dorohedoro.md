Everything feels so new, the art is perfect for the story and the entire cast is great. Every character is an awful person but killing is just so widely accepted in the world you end up forgetting about them being the worst. Its world building is great to a point where it actually feels like you are looking into a living world not just a chunk of land that just appeared so you can spectate.
