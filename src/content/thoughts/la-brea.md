Spanish Black Country, New Road. Straight up. This might be the most derivative album I've ever heard but my BCNR glaze is immeasurable so I couldn't help but enjoy this despite the album really having moments where I just thought, cmon man, because it was clearly so heavily inspired. La Brea also could've been better if the microphone sounded less choppy on the more screamy moments. Even though my complaints may make it seem like I didn't enjoy this album, I can't lie, this was great. The instrumentals were awesome and I thoroughly enjoyed hearing this man yell despite only being able to understand about 15% of what he's saying. Likely my favourite album this year so far. Perhaps dragged a little though.

Edit: 7.5 -> 7, kind of grew off me, the later sections are a lot weaker than the earlier. Album would've been better off ending 20 or so minutes earlier.

Edit, 7 -> 6, this has grown off me even further. It's just too blatant, anytime I consider relistening I just listen to 'For the first time' again.

Edit 3: 6 -> 6.5, you know what Yo La Tengo is really good though so I'll bump it up a .5 just for that.
