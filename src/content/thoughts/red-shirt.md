I can't believe this even exists. Modern day revenge story manhwa authors are so fucking stupid I can't believe they keep coming up with the same manhwa over and over but it manages to get worse every time. This some Habsburg shit, I don't even know anymore. When I read the first chapter I couldn't believe my eyes, every time I thought it could've become less stupid it doubled down over and over. How hard is it to write a character that isn't cardboard all the way through, I don't need them to be skin quality, I'd be just fine with silicone, but I guess it's much easier to write villains and heroes without an ounce of personality or nuance. Fuck this manhwa.
