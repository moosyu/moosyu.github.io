Feels pretty aimless in the recent chapters. The start was pretty alright though. 

 4.5 -> 3.5, wow this has gone even more dogshit than the last time I checked it out. It's sad because I really had high hopes for this but the longer it goes on the more bizarre and aimless it becomes. It seems like even the art has gotten worse in the later chapters, it's all so flat and weirdly proportioned now. Maybe the artist and author just need a break or something but I don't think I'll be returnin again.
