It's another predictable romance manhwa. The art is fine, the story is nothing special but it's not that bad just not my cup of tea and the characters are fine as well but it entertained me enough to finish it, also my brother saw me reading this and now I think he thinks of me as less of a man. It's easy to skim as well and I think I got about the same experience with a quarter of the reading. I think her brother is also a closet homosexual because like he didn't know she was a girl, he was just into a guy. 

 Edit: This is mid but more fun then I gave it credit for being.
