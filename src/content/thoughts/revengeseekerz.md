Didn't even realise this dropped what is going on today 😭. The first track wasn't for me to be honest, maybe I was just adjusting to the manic vibe or something but I just thought it was a bit much which is a bit of a reoccurring thing on this album for me. I think I liked these songs a lot on their own but when combined it's just too wild and out there for me to not feel insane listening to (especially while just sitting around in my house, the vibes weren't right). The Danny Brown feature was great (as always), Star people is wonderful too and probably my favourite song on this aside form the two singles. Revengeseekerz is fun but a bit too headache inducing for me to fully enjoy though it is nice how it relaxes a little after Dancing with your eyes closed so it was significantly more enjoyable. (By the way was that the Fortnite marker sound in in Fadeoutz?? Insane but its fire lowkey.)

Edit: 6.5 -> 7.5, out of all the albums that released on the 4th I find myself coming back to Janes the most. I'm not sure what it is exactly but this has become a really enjoyable album for me. Maybe it's given me enough ear damage for me to not get headaches any more but I just be vibing out to this one.

7.5 -> 8.5, can't stop listening to it won't stop.
