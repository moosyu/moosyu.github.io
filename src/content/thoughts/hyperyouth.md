Didn't actually know this was dropping today so I kind of lost my shit when I opened Spotify up to find this waiting for me and this was quite the album to be snuck up on by. I had really liked NO HANDS (which inexplicably doesn't have a review here despite it being one of my most listened albums of 2024) so although my hopes were already pretty high for this they were kind of blown out of the water.

Although there were a few corny moments on this the theme was clear and very solid which I appreciated with some banger narration by my goat BMO. Dunno how they managed to get that cleared but they're so real for it. They also some nice variety in their songs this time round with some being dead beautiful like IS THIS LOVE and DISCO TOMORROW (I love DISCO TOMORROW so much, one of their best) all while still having bangers like BUST DOWN in which Brae employs his profound intellect to think up lyrics like "I'm half amazing and half Asian, I'm so good, you could say I'm Am-Asian". They also have the line "So much swag, call me a swaggot" which may be one of the only times I've actually laughed at a lyric and it was intended. These guys are just so funny dude. Peggy song is quite the banger too and had been a track I kept coming back to ever since it was released as a single, JVB's features always seem to go crazy. Aside from that I don't really have much to say aside from gushing about this album more than I already have, just a big step up in every department for the pair and I can't wait to see where they go with this. If Geese's album bangs 2025 might make a crazy comeback.

Edit: 8.5 -> 8, myeh, kind of grew off me a little. Might've just listened to it too much though.
