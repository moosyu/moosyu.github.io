Read this one in a trance. The story was giving Eleceed vibes with how repetitive it was but unlike Eleceed the cast isn't charming and the art isn't good.I didn't particularly like a character in this and the writing was more often then not overly edgy. If it wasn't so easy to digest I wouldn't have finished this one, kind of disappointed in myself for wasting this much time though, this is below Youtube shorts level slop.
