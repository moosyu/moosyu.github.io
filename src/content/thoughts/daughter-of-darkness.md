How people feel pretending to like music on the internet.

Is this album haunting and eerie?? I'm not sure. I wasn't really even listening to this album, I was just doing shit and paying it no mind the majority of the time. Did they expect me to take a seat and listen to mysterious sounds for 7 hours straight? This just sounded like one long ass boring song that was intermittently interrupted by whatever sparkles sound like and some guy who sucks ass at yodelling. The only way this 'atmosphere' you guys are going on about is as pronounced as you say is if the atmosphere is me walking through a cold ass street for 7 hours with nothing to do as I slowly lose my fucking mind. Like I was kind of enjoying the atmosphere for the first 20 or 30 minutes but this shit just drains you, I felt tired after listening to this album. It is funny to see the Spotify views drop slowly as people get bored out of their minds listening to this.

I think I'm going to get an early night.
