I might be going insane with this one but this album is genuinely good. I'd never heard any Bladee before this but from his vibe I expected his must to have a heavy kind of sound to it but this was not at all what this album was. I expected something along the line of Carti but not only was this not a trap or rage album, it was more pop if anything. This whole thing from production to vocals was so pretty and floaty. To be honest though sometimes his voice limited this project, it wasn't awful but Bladee also isn't exactly the most talented vocalist (or Ecco2k, I'm unsure who is who to be honest as I've never listened to one of their solo projects before). Listening to this felt like eating cotton candy, No loudness or anger just some chill shit. Every time he stopped speaking for a moment I expected some Jane Remover ass explosion and him to start screaming (not that I dislike that production style) but it being chill all the way through was a nice change of pace, felt like I was being elevated onto some sick ass clouds or something. Edit: 7.5 -> 7, not sticking super well, a little forgettable.
