Zhou Laoshi would be impressed. 

 Edit: This manhwa is great, probably one of the best ongoing even outside of the murim genre. The art is fuckin stunning, apparently there is a full team working on this and it shows, they hardly cut any corners especially with the awesome, massive fights. Moments where all the characters are just sitting around on the other hand often integrate the free assets you see often in other manhwas and while it stands out a little and I'd prefer it to not be with that way, I'll give them a pass as clearly the dialogue is more important than the art in such scenes. 

 The actual story is good too even if it's sometimes a little repetitive, some arcs, especially those earlier are on aren't my favourite but it really picks up and almost every later arc is really enjoyable and the camaraderie between Cheongmyeong and his sect siblings is charming. There are even some tear jerker moments that feel heartfelt, really has anything you could ask for from a shounen manhwa.
