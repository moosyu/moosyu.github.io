Great art style with a old fashioned picture book kind of vibe that makes every page interesting to look at. An interesting world and the curse is a cool idea. I liked the whole cast. My only issues with it is that it felt as if it ended a bit sooner then I would have liked. I think it needed more time to flesh out its ideas and so the ending would make more sense because reading the ending was really confusing (or I might just be stupid) but even with confusing bits once I fully understood it I think it was a decent conclusion.
