I'm about to go through a load of Adventure Time comics and I really cannot be bothered to write much about all of them, so like just be warned we are going to get sloppy. This comic seems to be an anthology series about BMO just by a bunch of people, none of them really have a super interesting plot, they only have about 10 pages to work with after all, but they're very sweet. The first is my favourite, I found it the most funny of the bunch and the artstyle that kind of reminded me of Pikuniku was charming too though the fourth was a close contender just because of how cute it was. They all were pretty funny and cute though so this wasn't a bad place to start off, I do wish some of them weren't as disjointed though because lowkey sometimes I just had no clue what was even going on as well as the second to last just being a dud that didn't do anything for me.
