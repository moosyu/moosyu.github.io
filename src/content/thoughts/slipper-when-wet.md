 My dad really likes this album so I decided to give it a shot and sorry dad but it's just alright... It had some great songs for sure, Livin' On A Prayer is an all time classic and You Give Love A Bad Name is just as entertaining as it is corny. It loses some steam though later on and its just a little too unapologetically 80s for my taste and it doesn't really seem like its doing anything too different from the norm of that era. 'Remember when we lost the keys and you lost more than that in my backseat baby' is the funniest line of all time though that shit is so stupid that it looped around and I think it might be genius.
