Mmmm, I'd like to rate this one higher but there are just a lot of songs that I don't really vibe with but also Jet Fuel and Come Back to Earth are some of my favourite songs in hiphop, if this only had those two it would probably be an 100 (I mean probably not because that would fuck up the flow but still you get what I'm saying). Edit: 7.7 -> 6, I just don't really find myself super interested in this album atp, lots of a duds tbh.
