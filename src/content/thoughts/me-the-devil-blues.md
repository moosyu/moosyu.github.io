After two of the least unique things I've ever read this is a real switch up. Aside from Steel Ball Run I don't think I've ever read anything set in olden days America, definitely not something that is set in our reality (kind of, I'm sure most of this was made but it's still based on a legend from the real world). The art is jawdroppingly pretty, it does have some of the lingering characteristics of an later 90s early 2000s manga with a more comic book-like style but it still has some crazy ass panels especially when RJ is playing music, it can be super awesome when it wants. Its also cool to have a story this good about someone so important to blues music and to see the kind of world he lived in (more the racism part less the devil being real part) though admittedly I don't actually like his music all that much. Clyde of Bonnie and Clyde fame was there too... dunno why, don't think he was in the original legend he was just here but his and RJ's friendship was always a highlight though they were only really friends for ten or so chapters. My main issue is that sometimes the pacing feels a little off and makes it a bit hard to tell what is going on at any given second but that may also be because I read all 30 or so chapters that have been released so far in about an hour or two. It's a shame this will likely never finish as apparently the original raws have been in hiatus since at least 2018 but it is what it is I guess.
