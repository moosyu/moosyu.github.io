Great story with interesting character development especially because his development is a lot more abstract then other stories, also how is the most hot girl actually and a man. My only issues are that at some stages it gets kind of boring and also later on it creates characters that seem unrealistic and kind of one dimensional (granted I've never been to art school) but for a manga set in our world the characters just seem a little too eccentric.
