One of the weakest zombie apocalypse stories I've probably ever read. It drops all the tension and drama that makes zombie apocalypse stories good and instead replaces that with whatever this is. The characters are way too cartoony, they don't feel at all real enough for me to care about them, in the start of the story this guy literally loses his arm and it's played for laughs which is such a weird choice to me and by not adding more shock or whatever it makes the story feel not grounded at all. Like sure maybe he's trying to stay strong or whatever but I find it hard to believe anyone wouldn't be a little freaked out by the end of society as we know it on the back of losing a limb. The same goes for most of the cast too, people in this Webtoon feel like they must be AIs or something with how awful their memories are, they're capable of brushing off insane moments in one or two panels and it just doesn't work for me. The story is fine, not much to say about that and the art is pretty bad, definitely doesn't feel nearly as polished as other Webtoons I've read (though I guess in general Webtoons are more a mixed bag as they have so little quality control), there aren't even any backgrounds much of the time and if there are backgrounds it's usually just one or two flat colours.
