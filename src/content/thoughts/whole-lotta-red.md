I'm sure if I was to listen to this five years ago I'd have been blown away but these days a lot of people have been inspired by WLR's style (and done it better) so I wasn't too shocked by the production on this album. Of course it had some great songs, it wouldn't be so well regarded if it didn't, the first three are extremely solid especially Rockstar Made, and Sky is popular for a reason. Extremely fun and catchy, unfortunately most of the album feel like filler slop and the production can't carry it through especially when everything on this album feels so unchanging from production to lyricism. Its industrial glitchy beats are interesting at first but don't do enough for me to be able to not feel drained after listening to 24 of them.
