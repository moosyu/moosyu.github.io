I don't know enough Spanish to listen to this. Straight up. I know a bit of Spanish, I could probably hold a conversation with a second grader but thats about my extent, so when she switches between Spanish and English I feel like I'm having whiplash trying to figure out what she's saying because I'm not smart enough to understand the Spanish sections without a lot of thought. I think I'll relisten to this once I'm more literate and I imagine it will be better.
