Just read the title. 

 Edit: 5.5 -> 6.5, wow, this was a real lazy one from past me and doesn't really give this story enough credit. It's a pretty unique twist on the murim genre, the concept of demigods getting urinary stones or syphilis and requiring doctors just like us isn't one I've seen before so it kept me well engaged. The art isn't my favourite, but it's unique (to its detriment in my opinion, but still). The MC isn't a huge dickhead which is nice, it's not some overblow OP MC slop either (though the MC is pretty powerful) and the dynamic between him and his master is very charming. It does seem to lose its way later on and the story becomes a little convuluted but I still thought it was fine.
