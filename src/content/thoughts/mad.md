I have no idea why this is bordering on a 7 on MAL, this is a very promising first eight chapters and I think I'll keep up with this series. Maybe its just because im a fiend for post apocolyptic stories though.

Edit: I have not kept up with this to be honest, I think I'm going to give it a year or two more to marinate so I can read 100 or so chapters.
