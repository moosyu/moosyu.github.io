Who could have guessed one day a Brazilian furry would make a better rap album than what Kanye dropped. While I can't judge it lyrically due to a language barrier this shit just bangs, all the beats are wonderful and YUNG LIXO has a really good flow. The final track is my favourite and I've been blasting it since release.
