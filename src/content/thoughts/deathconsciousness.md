I think I might like shoegaze (wtf) ?? I've never been depressed (I'm somewhat of a mental health massiah) so it's not like I relate too heavily to whats being said here, but I can hear the emotion in this and it's mad beautiful tbh (and just between me and you, I cried on 'There Is No Food'). There are also lots of bangers in this album too, like half of this album is going on my regular listening playlist and theres nothing anyone can do to stop me from playing them when I get the aux (I don't get the aux).
