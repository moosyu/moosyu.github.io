A lot more wacky than you'd expect for a film with such a grim premise, the dialogue is often comically over the top. The characters seem to inhabit a Pulp Fiction-esque world where police both do and don't exist in some state of quantum superposition making it completely possible to shoot out a window in the middle of New York and get away while also having hundreds of people storm your house after an hour or so of search for you. For some reason though, instead of going with fun over the top, the movie decided to go with depressing and uncomfortable which made the over-the-topness come off more corny than funny. 

The girl did pretty well especially considering how young the actor seemed though, but by no fault of hers the script seems to be on some fucked up anti Madoka Magica shit where instead of a 14 year old acting like a 5 year old this 12 year old acts old and jaded as shit. Maybe I was just a stupid ass 12 year old or something but Matilda seems way to into smoking and wanting to kill herself for a 12 year old even if she's had a fucked life and its a little jarring. 

 The weird 12 year old having a crush on her old ass father figure was fucked too and didn't help the movies situation making it infinitely more uncomfortable to watch. I'm sure they were going for something with Matilda being a kid and having confusing emotions n shit but it was weird and deeply disturbing which are both things I don't go out in search for. The music was quite nice at least, I was a bit surprised by the inclusion of Bjork, forgot she was popular for a while.
