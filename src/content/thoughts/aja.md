Very good album up until 'I Got the News' which really pulled it up to an eight for me, that song is perhaps too smooth, impossibly so. Was a little disappointed that this wasn't 'The New Sound but less horny' like it was advertised but I got over that pretty quickly and just enjoyed this album for for it's endlessly funky jazz rock. Edit: 8 -> 7.5, not a super memorable album unfortunately.
