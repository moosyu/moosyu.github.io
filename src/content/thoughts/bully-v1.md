Preacher Man and Beauty and the Beast tricked me into thinking this was going to a good album it was so sad when Close To You / White Lines came on and it was the worst song of all time. Super lazy project from Kanye, apart from the first two songs and the last the vocals were dogshit as well as having the worst Spanish of all time on Last Breathe. The production was just alright on the majority of this. This was less disappointing for me than Vultures 2 mainly because it was like 20 minutes long and I already knew my goat was washed but it's still kind of sad to see.
