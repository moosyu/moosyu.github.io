How did they fit bad characters with a loser MC who complains too much, a boring plot, bad comedy, found time to fit in a cliche why is my heart beating so fast scene and had him defend the boss from trash talk less than 10 chapters after he did the same thing all in a single package? The only saving grace from this dropping any lower is that the side plot about the celebrity guy getting 0 bitches was pretty funny and also you can read 40 chapters of it in like an hour so it's some pretty good junk food.
