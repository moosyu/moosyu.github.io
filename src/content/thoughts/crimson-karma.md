type: Manhwa
score: 2.5

Didn't expect a story without the romance tag to be 80% romance but jokes on me I guess. 

 Edit: Dropped the score from 6.4 -> 2.5. Idk what I was on when I first read this but this shit is so corny oml. I also feel like the author might just not be good at their job, like some of this shit was comically absurd and I just don't understand the power scaling in this world, she's not using any secret powers (at the time) or anything so how can she beat up a bunch of guys at once? Besides that it just comes off at unfocused constantly, it should be focusing on one thing and doing it well but its just trying to do a bunch of stuff shitily.
