The art in this comic is so pretty, it's like I'm taking a picture every few pages. I'm also quite enjoying the story, it's unique and keeps me guessing as well as somehow managing to feel less over-the-top Tumblr-lesbian than other Western comics despite girls kissing all the time in extremely over-the-top ways, it's quite odd (I know that vibe usually comes from Webtoons but still). It helps that all the characters a just cool as hell too, Allison with all the scars and long white hair looks sick, sad she got the lesbian cut so soon 😢, Incubus is such a sexy mf with his big ass star earring and White Chain with the prayer beads?!!? All I know is one day I wish to reach their level of drip. 

 The characters also happen to just be unapologetically cool while still having room to develop which is something a lot of comics, manga especially struggle with. Them kicking ass and having their ass kicked are both equally fun to watch, the fights are great especially later on, some of the best I've ever read. They are just so giant and explosive they're a joy to read. The world itself is pretty wacky and fun too, maybe it's just because I've read a lot of manga but I haven't seen something like this wild and diverse in characters and world design since I read Saga. My only big issue was sometimes I found the story a little hard to follow, though it may just be due to how illiterate I am. There was just a lot going on though, lots of panels felt like some were's Waldo shit and it was sometimes to the comic's detriment even if it's undoubtedly cool to look at a big ass battle with so much shit going on. I love you Solomon David.
