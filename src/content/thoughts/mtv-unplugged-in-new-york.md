My favourite performance from Nirvana, very strong album with the best variant of every song they perform except for the 'Man Who Sold the World' and I will die on that hill. kurts range musically is crazy and fun fact apparently someone bought the cardigan he was wearing for $334k ??

Edit: 8 -> 7, just wasn't feeling it as much upon a relisten.
