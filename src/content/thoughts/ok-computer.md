Somehow last time I rated this I gave this album a 5 and called the mixing awful. I don't know what I was talking about, maybe I was listening to the wrong album but this entire project is lovely. Even 'Fitter Happier' had me hooked and people hate that guy.

Edit: 8 -> 8.5, I've relistened to this about five times since I last spoke about it and I can't see myself stopping soon.

Edit: 8.5 -> 9, again, super replayable, keep coming back to listen to the entire album it's fucked up. Not a single skip.
