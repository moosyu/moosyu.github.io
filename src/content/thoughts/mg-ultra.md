this album is like a really long stride in the right direction after uvoid which was dogshit. like its still in the same vein as uvoid creatively but way more refined. still doesn't have the same level of autistic energy as because I'm young and arrogant. hot lizard is absolutely a banger though. this album felt a little more accessible too? like your grandad would probably still die if you played this for him but it would be only one stroke instead of three. Edit: 7.8 -> 5.5, not quite sure hwat happened but this album sounds a little annoying to me now.
