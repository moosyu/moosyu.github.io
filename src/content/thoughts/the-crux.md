This might've actually been one of my most anticipated albums of the year and I'm so happy it's good. The singles were both wonderful, and this is a very charming and fun album. To be honest I was getting a lot of Jack Stauber vibes especially early on but I think Djo might do it better. The vibes in this are infectious and I was tapping my feet off to almost every song.

The last third of this album is my favourite stretch for sure as it feels the most different from other things I've heard previously (though it certainly shared some DNA with The Beach Boys and The Beatles). Even the unexpectedly mellow moments on this album like Golden Line and Crux (which gave me Stardew Valley vibes for some reason??) were enjoyable and nostalgic (which was definitely the vibe this album was going for), never completely blows me away but it's just a good time overall. I love you Steve.

Edit: 7 -> 8, idc I think I've listened to this too much to not give it this rating.
