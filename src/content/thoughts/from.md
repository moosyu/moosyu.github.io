No clue how this isn't at least an 8 on IMDb because this is easily the most captivated I've been by a show in years and if it sticks the landing and ties everything up in season 4 it might just become a 10. Often very spooky and the mystery elements had me fighting the urge to Google what would happen next. I also find the characters to be very sympathetic, not sure why the commentors on the shitty piracy site I used seemed to hate them so much.

Edit: 9.5 -> 9, upon a rewatch I found there to be a lot more bad acting than I remembered especially from the lady who plays the mum that made some scenes jarring.
