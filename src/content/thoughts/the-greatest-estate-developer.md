Trolling so hard people don't think youre trolling and then you actually aren't trolling anymore. This was originally an 8 but after reading Love Advice from the Great Duke of Hell and Hinamatsuri (both more funny and well written) so I couldn't justify it's place so I dropped it down 2. 

 Edit: I think the longer I read this the less funny it gets. Faces arent funny forever.
