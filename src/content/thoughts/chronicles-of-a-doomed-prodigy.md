Pretty bland. The art is good and the way they're using the guy dying at 20 as a way to progress the story quickly is a pretty good idea as opposed to just like making him cure it instantly or something but that's about as far as anything interesting goes. There are elves for some reason... they're just there. I feel like they're meant to serve a bigger purpose, being called noble races and all but really at this point (to be fair, pretty early in) they just exist. The characters are completely uninteresting, I couldn't tell you the name or personality of a single one because they've all merged together in my mind including the MC who acts nothing like a 15 year old despite not being some reincarnated guy or anything he's just weird. I think if he acted a little more his age he might've been more interesting but currently he's just an OP stoic slop man with no defining traits except being strong and quickly dying. The pacing is also pretty fucked, they don't stay anywhere for any time, they just show up, kill someone and leave. It's messed up. I get the whole point of this is the MC is dying but it's still a little jarring, the first battle with the tyrant sword tribe ended so quickly that I thought the second battle was still the first. Still early days but I can't imagine this one going anywhere.
