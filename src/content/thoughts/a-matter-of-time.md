This album scratched an itch I've been having a while now for some nice 60s pop (I think, basing this entirely off what Frank Sinatra I've heard though) but recorded using an actual half decent microphone. Laufey's voice is great and makes for a really soothing album experience, the instrumentals are generally pretty great too. It does drag a little at some points, especially the middle as the songs are often pretty indistinguishable from one another and it kind of sent me into a trance like state but not in a good way because I basically tuned it out and had to go back and relisten to about four songs, however that streak ends with Tough Luck. Tough Luck was probably my favourite song on the album, it was catchy, unique (compared with the songs up to that point) and felt like a nice departure from the formulaic-ness of many songs up to that point. The lyrical content of this album was pretty impressive too, maybe my expectations for pop are too low but lyrics having any larger purpose than simply filling gaps is an impressive feat imho.
