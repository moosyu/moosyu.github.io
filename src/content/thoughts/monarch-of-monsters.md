I think I'd like this more if I didn't have to fight Apple music to listen to it. My favourite song was easily Pest, the guitar and whatever brass instrumental was playing at the start went so hard, but it just went downhill from there and it really hit it's lowest point on Sludge where to be honest the name says everything. It was a boring 20 minute slog where I at multiple points considered just turning the album off and then once it finally ended Revenge Fantasy started playing and that song was ass too 😭 (not nearly as bad though). It seems like a lot of people got hit hard by this one but I just can't relate, perhaps I'm just a sheltered little whiteboy but this was far too hit or miss for me. By the way, was that a gmod sound effect on PLAY DEAD! PLAY DEAD!? I swear to god it was. When it comes out on Spotify I'll relisten to it and perhaps the pain of giving Tim Apple my credit card will have dissipated and I'll be able to enjoy it fully.

Edit: Upon relisten I will not be changing my score, this album was just as mixed a bag for me as on first listen.
