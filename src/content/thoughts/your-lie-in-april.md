This was genuinely one of the most beautiful manga and just things I've ever read and easily in my top 10 manga of all time. It's crazy that I put off reading it for so long because I didnt like the cover. Read it if you havent already and read it even if you have. 

 Edit: I still love this but I wouldn't say it's 'easily' in the top 10 of all time.
