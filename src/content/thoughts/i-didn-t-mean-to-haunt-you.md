The last time I listened to Quadeca was the Scrapyard series and all I can remember from that is how pissed off that the vibes didn't match the music, can't remember a thing about what the actual album (or mixtape ig) sounded like so I basically have a clean slate for Quadeca. Pretty unexpectedly banger album for me, for some reason I assumed this would be a rap album (it had a Danny Brown feature after all (btw the Danny Brown feature fitted unexpectedly well, I was a little worried but it ended up being for nothing)) but this turned out to be a banger of an art pop album. Honestly reminded me a lot of Bladee's Crest but felt a lot more atmospheric (might be the wrong word, Crest is pretty atmospheric too but just a different atmosphere I guess), moody and heavy but it worked in Quadeca's favour especially because of the topics touched upon on this album.

The whole concept of Quadeca having died and looking back on his life with regret is such a unique idea and is really added to with the powerful lyrics and banger production. I don't exactly have the vocabulary to express well enough how I felt listened to this wonderful album (which does bring into question why I'm reviewing music in the first place but shhh), you might just have to trust that its great and if you don't feel like trusting me just listen to my favourite song on the album, tell me a joke. I cannot explain why I love blown out percussion but its so peak and on this song especially makes me lose my shit every time, especially after such a pretty first four or so minutes in comparison. Banger ass album name too. Only weak moment was knots which felt way off from the vibe this album had up until and following it, with fantasyworld following it made it sound like if you threw a Porter Robinson song into In Rainbows, it's fucked up. The shitness of knots is exacerbated by it following house settling and fantasyworld following it, two of my favourite songs with my least favourite.

Edit: 9 -> 8.5, decided knots being here at all should decrease the score sorry gang.
