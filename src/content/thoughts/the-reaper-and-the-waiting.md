Cute little romance Webtoon, wish it was a little longer but the art was really pretty and the story was unique. I don't want to talk about this Webtoon though, I want to talk about the insane ass quest I had to go in to get that low ass quality image to your right. First off I just tried to take a screenshot like normal only to find that my phone wouldn't let me take a screenshot?? MY PHONE, which I PAID for isn't going to let me take screenshots of certain pages?? Not to mention I forked over $10 to those fuckers at Webtoon for 55 coins, 30 or which I spent on this series and you mean to say that they have the audacity to say that I can't take a fuckin screenshot?? I might've expected this on IOS but Android is gonna pull this shit on me too? So instead of being able to screenshot like normal I had to spend almost 20 minutes fucking around with patching my Webtoon app and probably installing 100 viruses in the meantime just to take a fuckass screenshot of a panel that I paid real money to see, this the type of shit that's gonna make me steal the entire comic and repost it for free just out of spite for you greedy bastards. And their bullshit screenshot blocking thing didn't even work either because I still have this fuckin screenshot like holy shit dude. This isn't even mentioning that I can only read most Webtoon stuff on their shitty laggy app which is filled with Temu ads even after I pay. Never giving anything to Webtoon again 0/10.
