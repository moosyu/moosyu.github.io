God this game's dull. To be honest I've never quite gotten into it past a few hours though that's not for a lack of trying as I've given it about five or six attempts but it's never really clicked with me. The gameplay loop is super boring and while it probably gets more complex later down the line, I'm not sure if I want to invest my time into playing a game where assumedly I'd have to be put through more of this. It's also pretty jank despite all the bug fixes, it manages to run worse than Elden Ring for me even at the lowest settings which is a little weird because it doesn't look nearly as good and on the planet I spawned in on the ground textures didn't properly load half the time. The music is real good though.
