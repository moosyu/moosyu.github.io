Was feeling in a Radiohead mood so I decided to go through their discography again starting with their coolest looking cover. I don't know what I was smoking on when I first listened to this but I found myself really enjoying it this time. 'The National Anthem' horn section was a real highlight and 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' was a wonderfully bleak final song (if you don't count the bonus track of course). I can't really see where the hype around 'How to Disappear Completely' is coming from but it might just take me a while to get it, who knows.
