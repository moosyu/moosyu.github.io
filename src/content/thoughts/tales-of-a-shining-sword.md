Everything from art to story just feel very amateurish. I'm not gonna harp too much on the dialogue because I'm like 90% sure it was bad because Nightscans aren't very good at what they do but even the general story feels very poorly paced and executed. The whole introduction section just felt like some bullet-pointed list that the author had to complete in a couple chapters as the whole thing is so horribly rushed no ideas and characters really get developed which kind of had me already not wanting to read this, especially with such a flat uninteresting artstyle too, characters especially be looking like some 2010s Tumblr artwork and it's painful. Anyhow I ended up dropping this after ~20 chapters, just never really caught my interest and it's not like the MC was interesting enough to keep me with it, if anything his high and mighty personality just made this easier to drop.
