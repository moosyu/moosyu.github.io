8.6 -> 8.8 -> 9.2 -> 9.6 -> 10. This album grew on me like crazy. Tonight I decided to give it another relisten and spent like a fully hour crying. I know it's a little cliche to say but this album feels like how it feels to be in an insane dream, where everything feels normal and you only realise how off everything was when you wake up. Incredible.

Edit: 10 -> 9.5, not hitting me the same sadly.
