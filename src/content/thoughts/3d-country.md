I thought I hated country because it was a bad genre, but it seems I hated country because nobody in the genre was doing it like Geese. This album is so fun and bullshit in the best ways possible. What I saw could make a dead man die is bars, ily Cameron Winter. The title track is my favourite off the album and a perfect song imho.
