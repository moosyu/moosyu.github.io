Just saw this was #2 on AOTY for this year so far and decided to check it out. It was meh, indie rock really isn't my thing but this album wasn't awful, certainly overhyped though. I imagine the score won't stay so high for long as a wider audience checks it out ofc. Don't like how it somehow manages to sound spiky though.
