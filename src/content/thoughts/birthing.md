Came in expected to hate this one but I can't lie it has some cool moments. Like when he's speaking in tongues in The Healers, that's fire, but the issue with the Swans style of making music is it takes way too long to get to those cool moments and then they draw them out for so long that by the end they aren't super interesting any more. This album also happens to be two fuckin hours long and considering 40 minutes is my preferred length for an album you can imagine it became monotonous and made me feel fatigued by the end of it which is not quite the way I like to end off albums. Liked it more than Live Rope at least, can't remember much about that album but I do remember how shit the recording of it was and this is pretty well recorded which is like the bare minimum but nice either way. If some of these songs were like five minutes instead of 20 I think I could've really enjoyed this album and I'm fairly sure for me at least the atmosphere would've remained pretty similar to what it is now, but they aren't so I didn't (but I didn't hate this).
