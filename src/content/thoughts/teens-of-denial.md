After listening to Cosmic Hero on repeat for a full day I thought I should perhaps check out the full album, so here we are. It still suffers from some of the issues I've complained about with CSHR before, it feels bloated but at least it doesn't sound dated or like a weaker imitation of another musician like The Scholars. The band even almost managed to avoid making a song way too long (looking at you Ballad of the Costa Concordia). From the start this album came out swinging with the sick ass riff on Fill In The Blank having me full baffled, it does slow down a little by track four but still manages to impress me every once and a while, though I can't deny I think I'd enjoy it more if there was more variation between tracks. Especially in the second half it started feeling a little tedious and well I can't say there are any bad songs on here, not many blew me away. As expected Cosmic Hero is a real highlight though. People talk about this album being mega depressing and I mean I get that, the lyrics are sad n shit but I didn't really feel anything in particular.
