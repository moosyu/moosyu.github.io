Still don't know what the astronauts mean. Super wacky, fun and sometimes depressing read. It's reletively quick to get through (part 1 at least). It does get a bit too bizarre and confusing at some points, especially near the end but even when its so bizarre I can't even comprehend it Chainsaw Man is a good time.
