Super solid art pop album. Definitely had some weaker moments especially at the end and never really had a song as fun as the first but SAYA tries really hard. Really excited for what Ms Gray has next. I also enjoyed the more experimental moments that I don't really expect from a pop album. Between this and The Weeknd's new album pop has really had a great few albums already this year.
