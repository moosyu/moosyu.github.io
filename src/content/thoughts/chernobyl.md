Super well done show. Not super familiar with the real world event so I'm unsure as to whether it's overdramatised though I imagine some aspects are but it was at least an engaging retelling of events. Scenes like the kids playing around in the soot from the power plant are so horrifying with context so much so that they don't need to say anything, they can just let it speak for itself. I know that isn't exactly saying too much but I can appreciate when a show knows that the audience is able to create cohesive thoughts.
