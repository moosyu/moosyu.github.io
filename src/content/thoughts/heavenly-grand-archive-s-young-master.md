A fine murim manhwa, I liked how it was an older guy being reincarnated this time because usually its some like 20 year old genius (though the way he acts isn't much different to the normal murim MC), the side characters are silly and entertaining too which is nice. My main issue is that this manhwa has a kind of fucked up start with the previous owner of the body wanting to off himself constantly and everyone around him worried for when he'd try again. I'm not sure how realistic it is as thankfully I don't have any personal experience with such topics but it was still kind of fucked and left a bad taste in my mouth.
