For some reason I kept trying to this listen to this record and then getting bored by Drunk Girls, perhaps I'm sexist idk, but after I broke my mental barrier I was able to fully enjoy this. I slowly think Mr System is becoming one of my favourite artists.

 Of course Dance Yrself Clean was the highlight but that's not to discredit all the other great songs on here, even somebody's calling me, which all the terminally online seem to hate was honestly great. It was very fun and if I was physically capable of dance I would've been throwing it back rn, alas I'm just a human soul trapped inside a computer.
