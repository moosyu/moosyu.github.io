When I was five I remember clearly, my want to have a Cinderella birthday party 🔥🔥. Shit is heavy, strobing and so awesome, got me bobbing my head on every song. The vocals are always great, the songs while not exactly catchy are real earworms that keep you coming back for more. The production is pretty out there but not in a bad way either, kind of like FKA Twigs or Xiu Xiu (when Xiu Xiu bothers making listenable music). It even gets intimate and personal, more so than I expected when I started listening, with some really uncomfortable moments like Headlights but I felt like moments like that only made the album more interesting. It does slow down a little near the end which I thought was a misstep though, if it had kept it's energy it might've been my AOTY.
