I feel like I've heard this same kind of sound too many times and it bores me at this point. It sounds like one of those credit songs but im the final boss videos. At some points it almost just fades into the background but then randomly increases its intensity and reminds me of its existence which I didnt appreciate. crystal ice caves was a nice change of pace though, I enjoyed that one.
