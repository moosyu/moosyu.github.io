Just a very well done 'regression' (I guess though he's only going back a day) story. If I had to make a comparison it'd probably be to Solo Leveling. Like Solo Leveling it's not the most intricate story, interesting world or fleshed out characters but at the same time nothing is done poorly either. The characters aren't over the top, they act close enough to normal people to not get pulled out of the story. I quite liked reading the continued teasing of the MC, it was charming and as normal manhwa comedy is anything but subtle it was a breath of fresh air. The art is very pretty too and the pacing isn't completely fucked in the sense that it's taking time for the MC to become stronger. Quite excited to see how this one pans out.
