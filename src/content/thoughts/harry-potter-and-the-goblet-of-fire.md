Bonus points for this one because I didn't have to see the Dursleys again. I like how this film was shot a hell of a lot more than the previous, felt a lot less gloomy and just more interesting to look at, I don't know if they bought new cameras or something but whatever they did, it's working, this is easily the best looking Harry Potter film so far. The CGI wasn't as bad either. I appreciated this film doing more to flesh out the world of Harry Potter, just there being different schools and having global sporting events helped break the monotony I was starting to feel after having watched three films in the same general area. Does have me wondering though, are there wizards in like China and America? There probably are if they had a Chinese dragon but surely they have a bunch of people strong enough to take out Voldemort, China has like 10x more people than Britain. I wasn't a huge fan of the Harry Potter has highschool drama plotline but it was decently realistic I guess (though the classic talking through other people kind of went out of fashion in year 6) and it was nice seeing Ron stand up for himself even if he was wrong in the end (my goat). I really felt like the dialogue had improved in this one too, felt way more natural.
