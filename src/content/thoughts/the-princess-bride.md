It was good, not exactly the masterpiece people have been trying to sell me but definitely holds up decently well. The performances are really what sell this one for me, it's over the top in the same way that plays are, which I'm unsure if it was intentional but it helped the film stand out. A lot of the characters are pretty iconic and their lines, while not sounding all that much like something a real person would say, do seem like something that'd be written in a book so yk it just works. Along with that this film has some really fuckin funny moments, that scene where Albino is talking all evil like before clearing his throat and being British was eye-wateringly funny.

What didn't age well was about everything that the actors didn't have control over. The film looks good some of the time but then also just looks shit sometimes too, I don't know how much this had to do with camera limitations of the time but that doesn't change it looking bad. The transitions between scenes and especially the shitty dubbing when the characters are far away or walking down hills or whatever really take me out of the movie. I don't think there's ever been a scene that makes me as aware that I'm watching a film as the one where Westley and the princess roll down the hill with shitty voiceover ouch sounds. Genuinely terrible scene that nearly destroyed the film for me. Also wasn't a huge fan of the little cutaways to the kid and dad reading the book, despite it probably not being cliche at the time (I assume), it feels overdone now and it's been done a lot better (the Lego Movie's use of it for example). The old guy telling the kid to shut up was funny though.

I know I've been lowkey bashing the film more than I've been praising it but it really was a fun watch and while it's not as timeless as people seem to think (imho ofc) it's still worth your time and I cannot overstate just how funny some of the moments in this are.
