The best Beatles album, Abbey Road put me to sleep but this is my shit, from start to end not a single miss the people on aoty are lying to you when they say this isnt as good as Abbey Road and Revolver. The cover is also fire, idk why they cropped Ghandi out though.

Edit: Went from 9.6 -> 7 I've grown to despise the mixing in this album.
