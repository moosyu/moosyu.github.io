Absolute hood classic, I'd give it a 10 if it didn't have so many quests where its just walking place to place but this is just really fun especially when you get later in. The dialogue is also pretty great and honestly really funny and witty, like this is one of those games where I enjoy just reading what these people have to say. Idk how I feel about the child gambling aspect but honestly at this point I feel like the majority of people playing are actually pretty old so its more just normal gambling. Edit: Nah actually edit fizzles have made me go insane and honestly ruin so much of the combat for me, also the MMO subscription based model is pretty outdated.

Edit 2: Can't believe I forgot to mention the awful load times this game has despite modern hardware 100% being able to load way more than they're showing a lot faster.
