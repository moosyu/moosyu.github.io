The greatest live album of all time. It solves any issues I've had with their other songs. Particularly 'ゆらめき IN THE AIR' and 'LONG SEASON' turn from extremely good to masterpieces. I genuinely cannot believe this was performed live. Some of the most beautiful, charming and mystical sounding music I've ever heard. I swear to god after this album ended I started hyperventilating and shit because I had my breath held the whole time.
