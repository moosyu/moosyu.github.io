Couldn't even finish this one. I must have a thing for pain or something to have watched The Human Centipede and Tusk back to back but everyone I know is evil and put on this just for funzies I guess. Since I'm not a little bitch I decided to watch this with everyone and by about midway nobody could stomach it. Genuinely made me want to throw up when it got to the stitching part, I've never had that happen with a movie before. Haven't even watched the first one either though it seems it's not that important to comprehend this one. I don't know who thought of this, I don't know why they made three of these, I don't know who gave them the money for this. I cannot believe this is real.
