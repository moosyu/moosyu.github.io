I swear to god I already wrote a review for this I think it got lost when I reset my PC or something so we just doing footnotes. Super disappointing album, Tyler's worst since maybe Goblin. It was cool that he was trying something new but also not really, Sucka Free seemed like a CHROMAKOPIA throwaway and any of the songs that actually felt fresh were shit. Quite tragic really. Hope he takes a break before his next.
