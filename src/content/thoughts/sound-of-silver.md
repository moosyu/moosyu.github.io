My favourite LCD Soundsystem record, it's consistent, fun and every track is near perfect (except for the title track but that still goes hard). The final track was a complete curveball in the best way possible and everything else was just classic LCD Soundsystem but at the highest level possible. You can tell just how hard this man laboured over every single song, they're layered but never have too much going on. All My Friends is one of my favourite songs of all time btw. Very excited to see what Mr Soundsystem has in store for me next.
