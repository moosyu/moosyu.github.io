A great project that I somehow didnt know existed until today, this album is great but I feel like if anything Doom actually brought it down, the beats were great but Doom didn't seem to be on his A game. Luckily Doom's B game is better than most rappers A game. Sofa King and Old School rules were my favourite songs, especially Sofa King that beat was fire. Edit: 8 -> 7, too many weak links.
