The most overhyped series ever??. It's unbelievably boring and repetitive, I hate every character and even if they are realistic it doesn't change the fact that Shinji is a little bitch, Asuka is just a bitch and Rei is hardly a person who has almost zero character development. The plot is so complicated and convoluted with a mystery that is impossible to understand without seeing other Evangelion media and forgive me for wanting a series to be able to be digested without going through other movies just to get an understanding of a mystery that should have been answered at the start. No characters ever die, and if they do they are alive in the next episode so I am never worried. The symbolism looks cool but is meaningless and looking cool was literally the entire reason it was added.
