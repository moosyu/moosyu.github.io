I was actually going to give this a three because it sounds like a piano falling down the stairs bass boosted. It also hurt kind of hurt my ears to listen to as well and EUSEXUA is bouta drop so I can't allow my beautiful ears to get damaged though for some reason I actually kind of love it and I can't explain why that's the case. A 7 seems like a pretty good score for something that lost me 1000hz of hearing range.

Edit: Already a 7.5 I can't explain it but I think I might really fw this album though it did take a bit of time to acclimate to it.
