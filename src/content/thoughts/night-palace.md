This album took me like 5 tries to get into and I think it was worth it, some of this stuff is mystical, like straight up I felt like I went into a trance like state listening to Co-Owner of Trees. Might need to relisten with a focus on the lyrics as I have no idea why Demolition turned into a podcast at the end but it was cool either way. The range of sounds on this album is quite honestly insane and the fact that they seem to work together is even more crazy.

 My main complaint was that yeah it just took me a while to get into, that's probably because of my inexperience with Mr Eerie but still gonna hold it against him idk. Also the album cover looks like dogshit literally every single cover looked better than this sorry Phil. Very rewarding album to listen to and I imagine my rating can only grow. Sidenote Spotify queued Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (the song not the album) after this album and the transition from I Need New Eyes to Scary Monsters and Super Creeps is scarily good.

 Edit: I Spoke With a Fish is great, love it a lot.
