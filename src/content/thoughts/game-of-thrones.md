Somehow manages to be bother over and underrated. I really didn't mind the final few seasons that people like to bitch about but at the same time I didn't really think the first few seasons that people seem to love were all that great. There's so much stuff in this show that doesn't feel like it needs to be there, I'm not just talking about having to watch like baby murder and shit even if that was pretty offputting but I feel like most episodes could've easily gotten their points across in half their runtime. There also just happened to be a lot of shit in this show I couldn't care less about. I was practically asleep during Daenerys' parts in the first like five seasons. It just felt hard to care about what was going on when they were so far from the main cast of characters despite being nearly certain that eventually there would be a climax to this storyline when she eventually takes back the kingdom. Same thing for whatever the fuck was going on with Bran but worse because I didn't have a clue where it was going.

My favourite character by far was Arya Stark, she was just out here on some real shit the entire time, her dynamic with Syrio Forel, The Hound and especially Tywin Lannister were so fucking good, the scene where Littlefinger goes to talk to Tywin while Arya is in the room was so tense in a good way and was really up there for me with that scene between Hans and Shosanna in Inglourious Basterds. This show was overflowing with good characters like that but it only really felt like it utilized a few, and somehow out of that small handful three of them were Lannisters 😭.

Another aspect I quite liked about Game of Thrones was the world, it's one of the few fictional worlds I've seen that was just really convincing, they made it very easy to believe that such a world could easily exist and wherever they shot was a great choice. The world did feel a teensy bit small but what can you really do, it's a TV show after all. It's a little silly that this is all I can think to say at the moment for this long ass show but yeah it's pretty good, not great but pretty good, did kind of leave me feeling bittersweet though as it felt like it had so much unused potential, maybe I'll watch House of Dragons to see if that's an improvement.
