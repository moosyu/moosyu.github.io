Installing this wipes out half my hard-drive in one click. The actual game is alright, the graphics are good, the performance is iffy even though I don't think it should be considering other games of its scope seemed to run fine for me. I really enjoyed doing the dungeons too but most of the open world wasn't super interesting.
