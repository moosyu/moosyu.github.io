My favourite Jojo's Bizarre Adventure part with one of my favourite villains of all time. Kira is such an interesting character and this setting was such a breath of fresh air compared to the previous massive worldwide trips. Kira being so interesting almost made me forget the random plot points they just forgot to expand on.
