Very pleasant jazz album. I should really have a lot to say after listening to a four hour album but it wasn't super in the foreground for me. I did really like Naadam though, set a good mood and kept throwing me off when I had thought I had this album pinned down. The second disc was certainly the weakest and I'd have loved if they maintained some of the intensity of Naadam in later songs but even still, listening to this and studying was a fine way to spend a Saturday.
