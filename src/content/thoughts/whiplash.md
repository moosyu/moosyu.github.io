Not quite sure how to review this one, I'd like to call it a bleak uncomfortable watch because that's what it felt like when I watched it, but the longer I sit with it the more Whiplash sticks with me. While I can't say I really enjoyed watching it, the characters are great and pretty well acted considering I've never even heard of most of the actors in this and the main villain was especially interesting, reminiscent of K from The Boxer (yes I know this came first but I read The Boxer first). Him being an evil obsessive asshole wasn't something you see super often and the actor playing him absolutely sells the performance. The only reprieve from the bleakness of this film was how sometimes Terence was just a dickhead for no fuckin reason, like I get he wanted Andrew to be the perfect drummer and all but sometimes he was just being vague to fuck with people 😭. The bittersweet ending was great too, the whole last section when he played Caravan was a masterwork and the performance almost tricked me into thinking I liked big band music for a second there.
