How did they make me relate to every character every chapter and why am I still remembering this now.

Edit: Just reread this and it was honestly better than I remembered. Real tearjerker though so depends if you're up for that. Not a huge fan of the fetus chapter because it's a bit weird that the author seems to be implying someone a fetus could have coherent thought but alright man you do you. I've seen some criticism of the art but it's not terrible and gets the point across though I can see how it'd be offputting for home. Looks a little like a slightly less hideous early Lookism artstyle.
