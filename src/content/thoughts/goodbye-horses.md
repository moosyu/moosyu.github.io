I'd love to rate this lower but I cant deny the fact that the song Goodbye Horses was so good. like this entire album bored me into a coma and then Goodbye Horses started playing and that shit saved my life fr. Can't believe its sitting on a 64 user score. I don't know how he pulled it off but somehow for those three minutes this mf surpassed all his idols he was trying to imitate during this entire album it was insane trust.
