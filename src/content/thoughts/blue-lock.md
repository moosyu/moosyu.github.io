Very good art, pretty alright characters and some corny ass dialogue. I also don't like how Anri is just used to keep the horny ass mfs reading, at least make her an interesting character. I don't mind the football being unrealistic though bc yk its a manga I don't care how grounded it is it just has to be interesting..
