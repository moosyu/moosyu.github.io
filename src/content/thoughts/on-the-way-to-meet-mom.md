The art is really good (though it seems to be getting worse), but the story is so boring holy shit. To be honest I kind of jumped the gun saving a screenshot of this and I really should've waited longer than thirty chapters to add a review for it but at the moment I am deeply uninterested in anything going on. Maybe if they had a protagonist who isn't an actual infant this could've been a little less of a nothing burger but as of now I wouldn't say this manhwa is worth your time (though this review will almost certainly be updated in the future with a little more detail).
