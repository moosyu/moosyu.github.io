Firstly, fire ass cover. like this was literally the only reason I listened. Ceres & Calypso In The Deep Time levels of eye catching. This mixtape is such a strange amalgam of styles and the fact that they all actually sound good is quite the accomplishment. My favourite songs are the ones that lean more into a jazzy sound but the more lofi songs don't bore me like I often find they do. Some of these songs even give me Luv(sic) vibes which was pretty awesome, especially backwoods. Good Luck Chuck was actually pretty disturbing too and a crazy curveball.

Edit: 8.3 -> 6.5, really grown off me to be honest, whether it just being a little heavy for casual listening or something else I find mysef skipping songs I have saved to my mix from this.
