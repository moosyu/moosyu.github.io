Only twenty chapters out right now but what I've seen its not even mid. The art, while not bad does have a weird feel about it, kind of reminds me of badly scanned manga that lose detail, but it's obviously not so I'm not sure how this happened, all I know is something has gone awry. The proportions are a little fucked sometimes too especially with background characters. Fortunately in the last few chapters the art seemed to have improved, no clue why but cool either way. The actual story is super generic, I'm not sure a single original idea was put into this entire manhwa which a little sad because there are so many ideas in murim that have yet to be explored and somehow we manage to just get the same thing over and over instead of anything new. Some of the moments felt like they were airlifted from Heavenly Grand Archive's Young Master piece for piece it was a little crazy.
