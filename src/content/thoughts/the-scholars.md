Did a lot more for me than Twin Fantasy to be honest. The recordings felt a lot more polished and clean and the vibes in general were a lot more upbeat so it was easier to consume. Reminded me of 70s Bowie too, glam rock shouldn't have died out we need more of it please. Even with this though I'm unsure I'll be coming back to this very often, it feels a lot more bloated than it should be but I guess making horribly bloated albums is CSHR's whole thing. This feels like it could've easily been 10 or 20 minutes shorter with very little actual impact, probably would even improve it. The almost 20 minute long Planet Desperation could and in my opinion really should have been split up into five or six songs as each section feels disconnected and varies in quality.
