Best Nicki Minaj verse ever on Monster, best Rick Ross verse on Devil in a New Dress and Runaway is one of my favourite songs ever. Listen to it if you haven't yet. The album art is also iconic and recognisable so it's pretty cool to have.

Edit: 10 -> 9.5, it just stopped hitting the way it used to I can't explain this one.
