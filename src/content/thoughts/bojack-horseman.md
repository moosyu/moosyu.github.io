type: TV Show
score: 9

A masterpiece which is the peak of mature animation in my mind (though the actual animation could be better). BoJack Horseman is what other mature animated comedies should strive to be, it's funny, clever and outlandish in ways that don't seem too crazy because its animated. BoJack horseman handles dark issues like substance abuse and BoJack's trauma of his terrible childhood in a very real way making BoJack seem like more of a person then most characters in other shows and hes not ever a person. Also it has Aaron Paul as todd whats not to love.
