Hello?? They got even better?? This album is borderline perfect. The lyrics, poetic. The instrumentals, incredible and even with a pinch of jazz that was absent from the previous project. The way they made the sounds of mining in songs like '采石'(The quarry) was absolutely awesome to hear and '河北墨麒麟' was so epic. Would be an 100 if track 3 didn't exist.
