This guy's voice is great and this certainly kept my interest throughout with interesting and pretty varied songs, I just feel like it could be pushed further. I don't mean to belittle Perfume Genius' efforts as I'm sure its taken a lot of work to get to this point but a lot of the time I spent listening to this album just made me want to listen to Surfjan Stevens as his music just feels like a more well executed version of the ideas in this album. I also lowkey expected 'In a Row' to be way more heavy like 'Punish' by Ethal Cain, I'm not quite sure why I expected that, it kind of felt like it was building to that so it was a tad disappointing to hear a less explosive ending than expected... Aside from that Glory seems to lose a lot of steam by the end which was a little sad too. Better luck next time.

Edit: 6.5 -> 7.5, this album grew on me a lot. I still agree with my assessment that it loses steam by the end but I didn't emphasise quite enough how high its peaks are. In a Row and Clean Heart especially are two of the best songs that I've not only heard this year but perhaps even this decade. I wish this album stuck the landing because it deserved so much better with the start it had.
