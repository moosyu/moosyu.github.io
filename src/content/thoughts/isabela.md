The first few chapters of Isabela were pretty flawless in my opinion and set the standards really high with an interesting setting I feel I don't often see in comics as well as stunning and unique art. It even had an intriguing story which honestly reminded me a bit of From for some reason (not a bad thing). I was very excited to see where this was going however, by about the time Isla turned vampire it really started going downhill, it felt like the story started overextending itself, doing unnecessary things and setting up new characters and plots without fully setting up previous ones. I stopped being all that intrigued because the story honestly revealed too much off the bat, the art is certainly good enough to keep me around for now though. Just gotta stop looking at the comments though because I almost forgot readers of any online comic are all fucking insane and would bang yassified John Wayne Gacy if they got the chance.
