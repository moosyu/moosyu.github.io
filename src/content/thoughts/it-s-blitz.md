Just a really good dance-punk album. I really only checked this out because it had 'Heads Will Roll' but to be honest all of the first four songs were incredible and if that quality was kept up for the rest of the album I might've given it a high 9, unfortunately there are som real duds in the second half. Even then it's a really good album still.
