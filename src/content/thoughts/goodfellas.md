Honestly pretty laid back vibes for such a dark film which wasn't a bad thing, I imagine it'd be a tough watch without some of the whimsy. The ending was pretty unsatisfying though, I get that it was based on a true story or something but I can't imagine much of this was true so surely Mr Scorsese could've cooked up a more interesting conclusion. The title cards are what really pissed me off though because you mean to tell me Karen and Henry went though so much shit and then break up off screen?? Shits fucked up. I'd like to say more about this one but I think I must've been in a state of delirium watching it, I had to ask someone if Jimmy was Jimmy or Tommy and we had 20 minutes left on the film it was fucked up.
