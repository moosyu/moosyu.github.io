This shit so ass. I was trying to watch Westworld with a friend on some shitty piracy site and they didn't have that but they did have this so we were just like fuck it and ended up watching this whole thing. The story is bland as fuck and I don't know how they managed it but the voice acting is so bad that it sounds like (or might be) that every line has been dubbed over. Maybe that's just because the film is so old and shit nobody bothered saving the audio properly and the audio track is fucked up and desynced as hell (not to mention the voice actors were very bad at what they do), at least there are English subtitles. I only enjoyed watching this because I was with a friend and we were laughing our asses off the whole time but if that wasn't the case I'd have turned this off in the first five minutes.
