Have I perhaps gone insane? I just don't understand why this album is so well regarded. Its nowhere near as interesting as a TPAB or even a GNX so I can't comprehend why they're regarded to be equals. Do bear in mind I've only listened to this album twice and one of the times was through a shitty Discord bot while talking to people so I'm not sure if that counts but both times I've kind found it to be fine. Lots of the hits, Money Trees, Swimming Pools and Backseat Freestyle are great and I understand why they're regarded so highly but in general this album just feels bloated even if you don't count the two remixes. The beats feel uninteresting and sleepy as do the Kendrick's vocals. I might even prefer his vocals on fuckin MOJO JOJO because at least on there he's entertaining.
