I dunno about this one, it was a bit too disturbing for me lowkey, once it got to chapter 36 I kind of had to stop reading because it was making me feel ill just reading it, I'd say it'd be a good read if you have a stronger stomach than me but its probably just not for me because there is rarely a reprieve in this from the constant stream of nightmarish content and with no morally good characters or even any close to being in a moral grey spot (closest to that is the female MC probably) it's just hard to keep going... The art is nice though. If anything this reminds me of a slightly strong Homunculus (or weaker depending on if you value disturbingness).
