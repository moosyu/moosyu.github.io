I used to pretend to like this one because it had young girl a on it which I thought was a banger, but most of this is boring and if I'm being real I'm not even if sure if I like young girl a that much anymore. This is like Youtube music but not from the actual Youtube music app, this is the kind of shit actual video Youtube tries to get you to listen to if you get what I'm on.
