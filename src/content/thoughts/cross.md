Had some real bangers like DVNO and D.A.N.C.E but most of the time it just blends into the background. Stress (the song but also the concept) was also just bad so that didn't help either. Yeah I'm sure this was ahead of its time and groundbreaking but listening to it now I just don't think it holds up.
