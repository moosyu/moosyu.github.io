Imagine for a moment, bones without the bizarre schizophrenia or the good art. What does that leave you with? An edgy mess of stitched together ideas implemented as poorly as you possibly could. The character has no growth, in the first chapter she's already batshit insane and any impact this could've had is negated by having happened in the first chapter. Half a chapter of her boyfriend being a huge dick isn't enough if you want me to really despise this guy, sorry. Like I don't like him but I also know nothing about him as he's fuckin paper thin. Kind of the opposite of Rachel from Tower of God.
