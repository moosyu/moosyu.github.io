title: "10 Hours Of Continuous Rain Sounds For Sleeping"
type: Album
score: 8

I imagine it to be difficult for musicians to stomach that the perfect ambient album was made four billion years ago by mother nature. Aphex Twin could never. Sadly I have to give this album an 80 though as I prefer myself some heavier rain and I'm not a huge fan of whatever material the rain is hitting.
