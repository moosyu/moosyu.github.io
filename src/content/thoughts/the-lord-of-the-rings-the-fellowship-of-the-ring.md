Holy fuck this movie is beautiful, it's hard to believe it's filmed in the same country I'm in. A lot better than the book lowkey. Some of the scenes really show their age, basically anything relying on special effects, the entire intro sequence looks like ass and the scene with Saruman and Gandalph fighting with stupid ass sliding sound affects and old man cries was so silly and took me out of it. Also a lot of the moments just feel a little too over the top to make them believable which negates some of the impact the moments could have for me.
