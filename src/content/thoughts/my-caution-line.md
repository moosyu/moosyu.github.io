The instrumentation was top notch the whole way through and it was out here constantly surprising me, like im pretty sure I heard an accordion somewhere?? Whoever was playing guitar was great too and I was even getting some bossa nova vibes at some point which was fun. Really dislike Orange specifically because of the annoying ass empty sounding drum in the background but that's the only song I straight up don't like. My favourite was Do Re Mi, had me nodding and shit, idk how it only has 76k plays on spotify.
