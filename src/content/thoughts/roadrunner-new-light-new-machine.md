Had some really great moments like the Danny Brown feature and the criminally underrated THE LIGHT but in general this didn't do much for me. While there weren't any bad songs (except for the JPEGMAFIA one because that beat was awful and annoying) the album never felt like it could hold onto my attention or did anything that I didn't expect from a BROCKHAMPTON album which would've been nice as now that I've heard three of these guy's albums I'm starting to want more out of them and their style here felt overshadowed by previous projects. Of course I didn't expect this to be an art rock album or anything but I'd just like a little more, perhaps I even wanted them to lean a little more pop rap than they did.
