I wish I could love this album, I really do. This is both because everyone seems to love this album so I feel a little weird not liking it but also I actually do love this album. I listened to it for the first time on speakers and it actually sounded great, Here, There And Everywhere especially was a real highlight and I kind of loved even the more wacky songs like Yellow Submarine. The problems really started to arise when I decided to relisten one day but this time I just had my airbuds on me and christ Taxman was one of the worst experiences I've ever had listening to music (a bit of hyperbole but still it was pretty awful). My ears are really sensitive or something so I get a real bad headache when music isn't mixed super evenly between both sides and wow I don't know what they were thinking but this mixing is evil. It's less bad on the rest of the album but still made the whole album just pretty uncomfortable to sit through so I can't really say I enjoyed it much.
