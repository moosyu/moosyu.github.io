Very French.

Edit: I haven't watched this film for a good few years but I'll try to give it a proper comment. The director seems quite proficient, I'm not really knowledgeable enough about film to say whether that's actually the case or I'm just being deceived by how artsy this thing is but it definitely feels that way. The shots are interesting and especially colourful, I think the use of a proper array of colours is just about the best choice the director made as if this film was just greys and browns it'd have been a much less engaging watch. Aside from that however the movie didn't seem particularly good at much else, the story was certainly there but it wasn't super memorable, nor were the characters despite the main ones being wacky weirdos. The pacing also felt a little all over the place to me. Not to mention while this thing being artsy was often to its benfit, there were also some moments like watching a childbirth that could've been cut out, maybe that's just the price of watching a French film though. Could've been better, could've been worse.
