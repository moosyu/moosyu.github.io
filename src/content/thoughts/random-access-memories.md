Lots of great stuff especially Giorgio by Moroder, Giving Life Back to Music, Instant Crush, Touch and Get Lucky. A nice and very thematically satisfying send off for Daft Punk, but it just never really clicked for me, I've listened to this about three times now and its still just really hit or miss imo. I think this would be better if I was a bigger Daft Punk fan.
