The game of all time. I have over 1000 hours and I regret none of it. Fun with friends, fun alone, fun without mods and even more with the huge variety of modded options from playthroughs. Seriously, some of the modern mods are insane, super beautiful to play with even if I end up falling back on Calamity more often than not.

Edit: Ok, I'm not dropping Terraria down from a 10 because its still peak but I should probably have talked about some of its shortcomings, firstly idk how they're doing backgrounds but it really shouldn't drop my FPS by 10 when I enable them. I'm not sure if that's just a problem with my PC but a game like Terraria should always be running a rock solid 60 FPS imho if Fortnite can do 144. Also this is 100% a wiki game, obviously whether that's a good thing depends on personal preference but had I not been told I doubt I'd ever have done something like summoning the WOF. Perhaps the Guide mentions something about it (I don't know why he would want to die though) or a voodoo doll could've fallen in the lava by accident but that's not a given. There are also mechanics like happiness and luck that while they don't matter all too much are still features and are hardly explained to the player (in luck's case I don't think they even try to explain it). I can definitely understand why people struggle to get into Terraria so I'd highly recommend playing it with a friend, it's how I got into it and both of us slowly figuring it out and watching guides are some of my fondest memories I've had gaming.
