What the fuck did I just watch. Me and a few friends decided to check this out because one of them reckoned that the movie was a documentary and really happened (not the first time I've heard this by the way) and no it's fucking not. This film lowkey sucked though, we all thought it was gonna be like funny bad but it was so fucked everyone was just dead silent the entire way through 😭. I get that it's meant to be a disturbing experience but it was just too much for me to stomach. Doesn't help that everyone in the movie sucks and the MC is so stupid like when he got his phone why didn't he just call the cops its like he wanted to die. Also why didn't the guy just buy a normal walruses?? Why did he need to turn people into walruses, did I miss something?? It was a depressing nightmare all the way through but I thought the cinematography was good at least.
