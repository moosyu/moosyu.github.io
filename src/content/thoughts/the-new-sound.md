GREEP SWEEP GREEP SWEEP JUST LISTENED TO THE LEAK AND HOLY SHIT AOTY IM NOT KIDDING!!!!!

Edit: Okay after chilling out and a few relistens this is even better than I first thought, 'As If Waltz' is my favourite song on this and one of my favourites of all time. I was bawling my eyes out on it istg. Such a powerful album in every aspect.
