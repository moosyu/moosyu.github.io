Very impressive album, surely my favourite album from Ms Ace of ___. 'ghosting' goes very hard and going from the cramped and distorted 'crimson' to the tranquil 'by then we'll be halfway down' is quite beautiful to be honest and might have been my favourite part of the album, kind of reminds me of 'if we cannot meet....' in CPU Buddha. I wasn't reading the lyrics so I can't really comment on them but I was just having a fun time with it so it's alright.

My main complaints are kind of incoherent and not very constructive but to me a few of the songs sound kind of uninteresting, I wasn't as big a fan of the second half of the album as I was the first, a few of the songs started sounding like some Canadian System of a Down or Green Day knockoff. Didn't like how skin was just a distorted poem and the recording (on the first song especially) is kind of liquidy if you get what I mean (???) which led me to not really enjoy it. Sadly my music word vocab is quite desolate so I'm unable to articulate what I mean. Very excited to see what you come out with next, easily the most interesting musician on this site right now (except for Nevermeant but he dropped one song and dipped so he doesn't count).
