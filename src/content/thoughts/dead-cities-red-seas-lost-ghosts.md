Went in knowing nothing, did not expect shoegaze but it was a pretty welcome surprise. I thought this one was really good especially On a White Lake, Near a Green Mountain where I could feel myself ascending to a higher plane or something. I might relisten at some point when my head doesn't hurt like hell though and see if my opinion has changed.
