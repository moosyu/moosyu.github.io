It's a cute read sometimes and the art is really good but the majority of this isn't my cup of tea at all. The rest of this manga is generally pretty tough to sit through, I'm aware drama is necessary to make something not a boring ass slice of life but it's for sure gone way too all in on the depressing factor and the rest of the manga is suffering for it. A girl dying is one thing, Your Lie In April did that premise quite spectacularly, however on top of that they also throw on that this girl got kidnapped because her stepmom and sister hate her, but then on top of that she's running away with a batshit insane assassin and they keep doing this about four more times, piling more and more depressing shit on until it's so uncomfortable to read through. Like this girl's life is miserable and even the moments of hope don't do all that much for me because like I'm not exactly rooting for you to fall in love with this heinous assassin guy so when I'm watching basically stockholm syndrome setting in it's not exactly a triumphant moment.

Aside from the whole idea of this manga seemingly like a bad idea to me I also don't really love the characters. Maybe the author is under some big time crunch but the character development felt really weird in this and just the way the characters acted in general. It really felt like it should've taken the bodyguard more time to join the side of the assassin (sorry I'm awful with names), like it felt as if only a few chapters had passed before suddenly they're going from wanting to actually murder each other to just arguing. Same with the MC and the assassin, any time they had any kind of dispute it was solved in less than a volume even if it's something batshit that I can't imagine anyone getting over so easily.

Despite all my complaining however I was still bizarrely engaged the whole way through 75 chapters (the amount of chapters released as of writing this) which usually isn't the case for anything I have as many problems with as I do this and strangely I'm pretty sure I'll be checking out at least the next few chapters especially because it looks to be starting to wrap up. For this reason I'm going to give it a begrudging five as I must've liked it at least somewhat to have somehow been caught hook line and sinker by it.
