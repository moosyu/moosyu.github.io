Sorry team, I don't know about this one. After Doves was one of my favourite songs last year I was excited to hear my first billy woods solo album so when I heard about this I rushed to listen to it but I just wasn't feeling it. It seems like everyone loves it but this sucks so much, billy woods monotone delivery does absolutely nothing for me on this production and these beats, I've tried to listen to this three or four times by now but it clearly just isn't for me and I've pulled the plug every single time. I'm sure the lyrics are just as dense and raw as they sound at first listen but I didn't have any semblance of a time good enough to actually look further into them.
