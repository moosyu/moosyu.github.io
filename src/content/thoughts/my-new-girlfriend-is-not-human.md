I know it's technically English so it's not a manga but it has the manga artstyle so it's fine. Pretty charming story, the art is nice, the premise is interesting and it certainly has its moments despite every chapter being only a few pages. I can also appreciate it not just falling into being only mindless fanservice which many similar manga end up being. Its more bizarre moments pretty intriguing too, especially that scene with Akane in chapter 40 and 41. Sometimes it felt like the manga was wearing its inspirations on its sleeve a bit much though, especially towards Chainsaw Man and it also seemed a little uncoordinated later on, it was also a little weird how that girl just forgave Taya for offing her family so easily.
