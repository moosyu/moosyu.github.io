Tally Hall and Will Wood want to be him so bad. He's to theatrecore what Kendrick Lamar is to hiphop. This man made an almost 2 hour long album and I've listened to it like 20 times. Every single track absolutely slaps and the bonuses are really just a victory lap. I feel like every song is so good every single one has been my favourite at some point. Likely my favourite synthpop album.
