This album is absolutely dogshit, I never want to listen to this again and I'm not adding a single song to my playlist, and yet I still think it was good. This might have been the realist album ever made. I don't know how he did it but instead of making music this man put his soul into this shit and honestly it probably shouldn't even be considered an album because it feels like something very different, this is like a Kid Cudi horcrux.
