This is like playing multiple separate games of 5D chess except you can't see the board, all the chess pieces are just grey rectangles, you can't see what your opponent is doing and just have to guess and if you move wrong once you die but also sometimes some random girl snaps either your board or your opponent's board in half and destroys all your pieces. Prior to L dying it was top tier, past that point it goes to shit but it was just so good I can't rate it lower.
