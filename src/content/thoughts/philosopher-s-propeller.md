Big shoutout to eye for recommending this banger. This was well worth needing to open SoulSeek for, this was a mystical, floaty ass album that I'm not even sure how to categorise. It leans pop but at the same time it's giving some classical and maybe even some trip hop? I really love how echoey it gets at some points and the overlay of voices and sounds, like when that bell plays on track three that was some real shit. Also this may have just been because I was listening to the highest quality flacs ever or something but track four got me disorientated, had to look around before I realised the voices were in the song, even gave me some There Is No Food vibes if you get me? I do feel like the album slows down ever so slightly in the second half and songs like track six feel a bit too long for their own good.

Edit: 8 -> 7, this didn't really stick with me the way I expected.
