With this album Black Country New Road had the almost impossible task of following up their previous LP Ants From Up There which is considered by many terminally online people, me included to be one of the best albums of all time. They also had their lead singer Issac who was one of my favourite aspects of their previous records leave. Despite this I found Forever Howlong to be enjoying and their change in direction to be intriguing (even if I preferred their previous style more).

This album still had some of their bombastic moments where everything is blaring all at once but it also leans more chamber folk and chamber pop than I felt in the previous, some moments in Two Horses especially had me reminded of Laura Marling's most recent album. I'm also told this has some baroque pop in it though I don't know what that means so just make of that what you will. Besties has managed to grow on me and might be my favourite song on the album now (For the Cold Country is a runner up too, wonderful song) despite hating it when first released. Charlie's voice is great and while I do miss Issac's bizarre vocalisations and cries I think she does a great job filling his seat.

Despite my praise I find myself wanting more from Forever Howlong, it's a really good album but I just feel like it doesn't go down as smooth as Ants From Up There or even Live at Bush Hall. It even felt like it dragged a little at some points (Mary and Nancy Tries to Take the Night especially, don't like either of those songs much at all, though at least Nancy Tries to Take the Night builds decently but it can't really make up for the energy lost by its boring ass start). This might just me needing a little time to acclimate to the newish sound, perhaps every song will end up growing on me like Besties did, but only time will tell.
