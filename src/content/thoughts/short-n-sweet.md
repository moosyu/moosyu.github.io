Welp, it's official, I've become too terminally online to listen to normal music. The push that finally got me to listen to this album was Dead Meat of all things, he did a killcount of the Taste music video, which while being a sick music video is also an unbelievably bland song. Not just Taste though, every song in this album is so bland that I forget them the moment I finish. Even Expresso which everyone seemed to like was so fucking boring that it had me wondering if maybe I just hate joy?? Even worse for me, the chorus to Expresso is so catchy that I've been endlessly torturing myself listening to a song I don't like. Why would you do this to me Sabrina? Very catchy, very good music videos but the music is like having plain white rice without any other dishes.

Edit: Expresso has been stuck in my head for an actual month I think I might just end my life soon (think bout me oh isn't that sweet I guess so, say you can't sleep I know that's that me expresso).
