What is going on?? 

 Edit: I never quite found out it seems. This is an interesting manga but the mood never felt quite right, just a little uncanny and I'm not sure that was what was intended. Moments that should've felt serious just didn't feel like it and the kind of sketchy artstyle wasn't helping the situation.
