One of those detective shows where the main guy is the smart guy who is impossibly good at being a cop. Usually not a good show idea because 1000000 of the same show already exist but this time its often funny and his solves seem clever instead of just bullshit. The whole mystery aspect that a cop show really should have is done very well here too. My main issue aside from the repetitiveness of the format is that Red John's capture sequence sucks, like you can't build someone up to be extremely smart by showing him being extremely smart and then just make him a dumbass at the end, like come on.

Edit: Rewatching for like the third time now and I forgot how good Rigsby is, the conflict between him and his dad is great and he's probably my favourite character (not that Cho is bad, they didn't do nearly enough with Van Pelt though). I just wish he was the primary focus of more episodes.
