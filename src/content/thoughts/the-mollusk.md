Another weird as album that somehow achieves its purpose (which I assume is making me an ocean man) perfectly. I've never really heard an album like this before and every song is really unique and I like it a lot, it's like a rollercoster ride but instead of ups and downs it just keeps going up until we reach the sun and die. As a side note Buckingham Green is way better than ocean man I swear to god.
