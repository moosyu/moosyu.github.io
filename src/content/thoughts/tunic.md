Would be a great game without a couple pretty huge flaws, firstly the camera is just sometimes annoying and makes the game hard to play and secondly the storytelling with weird crypticness just really doesn't do it for me, flipping through pages to find maps and shit is just annoying and a couple areas near the end are just tedious instead of rewarding. Edit: I wrote this before I played through the quarry and the swamp, two of the most pain in the ass areas in perhaps any game. I hate fighting the enemies that run away, it's just a pain in the ass. The boss scavenger is also just an annoying ass bossfight that due to the shitty camera angle often hits me when I shouldn't get hit (or at least it looks like I shouldn't). I can't believe I wasted 30 minutes fighting that guy.
