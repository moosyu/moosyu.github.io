A good time despite how bad the CGI is sometimes and how unhinged and directionless it becomes nearing the end. Not a giant fan of how formulaic the episodes are. Edit: 7 -> 5, way too long to maintain my interest and sometimes feels disconnected, like how did we get the biggest reveal in the entire series and then get some random stupid ass alternate timeline bullshit.
