This is 50% fanservice 50% something else and I'm not even sure what the something else is but its not good at either. If I wanted porn I'd watch porn. This is definitely not a 9 as it somehow got on Comick but the recent arc has unironically been really great (like an 8). Unfortunately thats because it is so different from the rest of the manga (the latest arc being the one where she cosplays as Kmart griffith).

Edit: 5 -> 3, I just finished this one and while the ending wasn't terrible or anything but I found out Marin was 15 which made a lot of the over the top fanservice so much more uncomfortable and I'm unsure as to why this isn't talked about more because isn't it kind of fucking insane?? It makes me feel like a pedophile reading it and I find it difficult to push that to the side like a lot of other readers seem to. Idk maybe I still have a soul or something who knows.
