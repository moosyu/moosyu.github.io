This is just one of those albums that you listen to because the name gets caught in your mind. Unironically one of the most fire album titles of all time right behind Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend! sadly the album doesn't match its titles coolness, in the second half at least. The first half is absolutely incredible which is the main reason for my score, the second half loses its steam a bit though, it's by no means bad but it just doesn't go quite as hard.

 Edit: 7.9 -> 8.5, the whole album has grown on me a lot and the second half doesn't seem that bad anymore, I was overreacting a bit in my first review.
