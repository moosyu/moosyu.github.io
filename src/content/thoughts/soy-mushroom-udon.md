Sorry for the picture; I know it's very soy-saucy and also looks awful, but I forgot to take a picture of the time I made these when I remembered to put the right amount of soy sauce. I quite liked these noodles. I like mushrooms, and I like not having to go to the store for ingredients during lunch because at that point I might as well just go somewhere that'll make lunch for me. Contrary to what the recipe says, these really don't take that long to make, more like 15 rather than 25, though those added ten minutes could be because they want you to add an absurd amount of mushrooms. Maybe cremini mushrooms are way heavier, but they don't have them at my grocery store, so I didn't bother with them and used button mushrooms instead. 113 grams per serving is batshit, and that amount of button mushrooms couldn't even fit all of them in the pan, and of those I actually managed to get in the pan, I only added about three-quarters to the noodles. Had I added any more, I was worried it'd just become one big mushroom or something. The second time I made these I kind of undershot the amount of mushrooms just to be safe to not have half a bag of cut-up mushrooms lying around and ended up with too few mushrooms. Unfortunately that's the only picture I had of these, so that's the picture included. I think ideally I'd want to add more, like six mushrooms, which would be ~60 grams. The third time I made this, I also added a sunny-side-up egg, and to be honest, I really don't fuck with egg on noodles, especially here when the mushrooms are the star of the show. Despite the trials and tribulations, however, I make this for lunch about once a week, so it's safe to say it's pretty good, though to be honest I'd eat and probably enjoy just about anything with mushrooms in it.
