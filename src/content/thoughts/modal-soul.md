Alright but very underwhelming. I really liked Nujabes' Luv(sic) series, it's certainly one of my favourite albums of all time so I assumed I'd like this album too but it's just so boring. I liked the first track, Luv(sic) pt3 and Eclipse but the rest was fairly uninteresting. As usual Nujabes' beats were the best part though.
