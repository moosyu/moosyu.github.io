Another basic regression manhwa 🥱. The art is pretty bad and while it does get a little better as it progresses it only becomes about mediocre by the point it's currently at, I thought maybe the MC not having an arm would be an interesting idea only for him to get the arm back like two chapters in. I feel like I've read this before but just better in things like The Swordmaster's Son so unless you're really craving for OP MC medieval slop shit then I'd avoid this.
