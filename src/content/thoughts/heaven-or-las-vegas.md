Pretty late on this one, not that I'm 35 years late but I had intended to listen to this album after having first heard the title track quite a while ago now but I kept forgetting to get around to it. Here we are though. Elizabeth Fraser is really what makes this such a stand out, her ethereal ass voice really brings this together and works wonderfully in tandem with the floaty, synthy instrumentals. I really like the way this album leans into shoegaze while still staying light with dream pop aspects thrown in too, it's a great mixture. My only issue with this album is that it feels like it's starting to show its age especially in the songs that lean a bit too much on some of the 80s new wave vibes (despite this album being made in the 90s) without doing more with them. I'm not 100% sure new wave is the right word but I'm looking at you Wolf in the Breast and Fotzepolitic. They aren't bad songs but any means, I actually liked them both but they just didn't have me placed in another dimension swaying my head with my eyes closed and shit like I was during the rest of the album, suffering from success I suppose. The less I can understand the lyrics the better.
