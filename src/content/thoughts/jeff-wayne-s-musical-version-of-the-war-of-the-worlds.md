Sorry Mr Wayne but your musical is really boring. This felt to me like a mix between Ziggy Stardust and Rainbow Goblins but worse in about every aspect. I'm not a huge fan of the narration here and while the album starts out sounding pretty interesting musically it gets repetitive fast and it's long ass runtime doesn't help. I also really didn't like how fucking complicated this story is and how much of it needs to be told in long spoken word sections, I liked Rainbow Goblins because its story was simple, nice and didn't require too much focus to comprehend. For this I felt like it was forcing me to go read the Genius page like an actual book and even then it wasn't a particularly interesting book.
