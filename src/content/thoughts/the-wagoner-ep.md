I've never listened to a Sematary album before nor have a listened to a Ghost Mountain one but I heard Apollon and really liked it so I had decent expectations and... is alright. It was certainly had some unique production, wasn't even aware horrorcore is a genre and I didn't think there was a bad song on here but the monotone vocals aren't my favourite and Silencer sounded like if a couple stoners made a Carti song but it did end up growing a little on me and might be the most 'catchy' song on here. I had really high expectations for World's A Fuck because it had like 16x more plays than anything else here and I liked it, maybe not 16x more than the rest of this but the MBV sample was unexpected and not just that, it had When You Sleep which is easily MBV's best in my opinion. I'm not sure if I liked it so much because of the sample or what but it was a pretty great finish. Now I gotta listen to loveless again...
