I got pissed the fuck off reading this comic, first off, its was cool seeing Princess Bubblegum leading a story, I hope one of them has her and Marceline though. That aside though this shit had no pay off, she was like fucked up and didn't know what to do about her friends being evil money men so I thought they were gonna get some real shit done but instead the rest of the comic was just like people apologising. Do not let them off so easy man, like girl they fucked up your whole kingdom and you're gonna be fine with them just apologising and giving stuff back?? She deserves an apology with tears and blood for what they were up to. Fern or whatever that green girls name was is way too forgiving for her own good, like without PB she'd just be fucked. Why am I more mad about this than her? Was I perhaps so confused because this is the fifth volume and I was meant to read the four previous first? Who's to say really (yes).
