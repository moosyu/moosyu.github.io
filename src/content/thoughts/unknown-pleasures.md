Extremely unfortunate that the first song is the best by a pretty wide margin. I think Day of the Lords might've had a chance but it just drags for a minute or so too long which seems to go for a lot of the songs on here, just not enough energy to go around. Not sure where all the hype is coming from because I found this to be a pretty uninteresting, boring album.
