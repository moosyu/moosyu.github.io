I don't know why they are making an Omori manga, it just seems like a bizarre choice to retell a game in manga form. I like the art a lot so far and the story is Omori which I thought was only pretty alright. I also feel like it should have been english originally and then go to japanese?? Like Omori was most popular in America, maybe to spread its influence but in that case I would have made it in Chinese or something. who knows.
