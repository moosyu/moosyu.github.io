Could've sworn I had already written about Hand Jumper but apparently not. This series is probably my favourite on Webtoon, at least until Vampire Family's season break is over. I love the diversity of powers and how generally unique the story is while still not getting too out of my comfort zone. Kind of a more depressing Eleceed if you can follow my logic. I also really like the MC and how she uses her powers in usually a very smart way even if some of the choices she makes do feel a little out of place and not thought out. The story can also go into a little too edgy territory for my taste sometimes but generally those moments are pretty few and far between. I would like if the author got to the point a little more as there seem to be a lot of strands at the moment and I'm still waiting to see how they connect. I can easily see this lasting 400-500 chapters but I'm pretty here for it to be honest. I do kind of wish some of the side characters get more time to be fleshed out too as a lot of focus is on just two or three characters when I feel like there are a lot of interesting people I'd like to see more of.
