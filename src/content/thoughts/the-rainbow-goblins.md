I actually didn't know how to feel about this album on first listen, or second so now on third listen I've decided this is really good. The wonderful jazzy instrumentals with great guitar work by Takanaka in combination with the childrens storybook-esque story being told by the British narrator man can't help but make me feel warm and happy. God bless this rainbow.
