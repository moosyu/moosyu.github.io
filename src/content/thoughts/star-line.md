Surely not an album worth waiting six years for but as a man who didn't really care I didn't feel the fatigue of the wait and just got to the enjoy the album. From that perspective it's pretty alright, could've been as good as Acid Rap or Coloring Book if it was trimmed down especially in the middle but whatever, at least it's better than The Big Day. At this album's best moments you can really feel Chance's inner Kanye shining through despite Kanye seemingly not being involved in this album which is pretty cool and as the #1 Kanye fan was nice as well as probably the closest we'll be getting to "the old Kanye" in any form for a good while. In its worst moments though this album is just straight boring which is a real shame and it's probably the nail in the coffin for chance ever being as big as he once was in the 2010s as this was seemingly intended as a comeback for him with the cover (which I'm 99% sure isn't AI no matter what people tell me) looking like it could've made itself right at home as one of his mixtapes. At least Chance won't be getting a Fantano 0 again.

Edit: 6 -> 7, yknow what, maybe I was too harsh earlier. Just relistened and honestly there aren't as many boring moments as I had thought and there were also some lowkey heartfelt moments that were real strong.
