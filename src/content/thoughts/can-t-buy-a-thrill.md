score: 7.5

Blends rock, pop and jazz (though it could've done with a little more jazz in my opinion), all crammed together into a smorgasbord of really fun and catchy songs. Almost everything has something going for it, generally I feel that the instrumentals come out better than even Aja, though sometimes it feels a little inconsistent in its quality. The singing on the other hand is consistency very Steely Dan, super lively and unique.

My favourites here were probably Only A Fool Would Say That and Fire In The Hole, the latter's groovy, blusey piano had my attention in a chokehold the whole way through and even gave off some Hunky Dory vibes. The former's bossa nova influence (I think) was a good time too though it lacked the tension Fire In The Hole did. Do It Again and the last three weren't as strong as the rest of the bunch though which brought my score down a little, just didn't do anything that I thought was interesting nor were they very catchy but they weren't bad my any means either, maybe just some nice background music.
