What an unoriginal plot. 

 Edit: After reading quite a lot of this I've come to realise that this story is extremely convoluted and actually makes no sense and the characters are sub par at best. I think I might prefer when it was unoriginal, it is entirely carried by its art now (which is way too good for this story by the way).
