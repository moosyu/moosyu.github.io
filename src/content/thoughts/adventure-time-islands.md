The art for this comic was really cute and I enjoyed seeing more of this vampire time period when there were still a fair few humans around as Marceline's backstory was one of my favourite's in the original show. The Jo could've been more interesting but she also wasn't terrible and seeing her develop was pretty cool, though due to the fact it was only a one volume comic it did have to be pretty quickly done. Seeing more of Tom's backstory was pretty fire too. My only real complaint is that I wish there was more of this though because of the ? beside the "The End" I'm hoping to see more of this. Fish Days was here too and had better art than the actual comic which confounded me.
