Lowkey I almost dropped this on the first episode because I hated everyone. Why are they all such assholes? You're in high school chill out. It doesn't make me feel sorry for them or want to root for them, it just makes me uninterested in the show. Tragically I ended up never liking the characters (except for Javi and Sammy because they just little guys) and when you root against the people it kind of ruins the show, also it was labelled as horror but it really wasn't that horrory? Fire ass cover image though.

Edit: 3 -> 7, since my first watch and writing this I have seemingly become a white girl, sorry. Misty grows on you hard and the rest of the cast does too, even Shauna and her husband surprisingly. I'd have liked if they finished revealing all the mystery a little more quickly but what can you do.
