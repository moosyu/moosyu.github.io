New Hell is a very interesting album to say the least. I've heard it described as heavy shoegaze but to me it really felt a lot more indie-rock leaning, especially the first song which gave me Racing Mount Pleasant flashbacks (in a good way). New Hell does its fair share of distorted, overpowering instrumentals but it's not really to the point I've heard in other shoegaze stuff, though that could be just showing how much I lack variety in my music taste. Classifying this thing isn't helped by New Hell never staying with the exact same sound for too long, it's a very fluid, varied album that showed off this band's capabilities quite well. It's variety in tandem with it's short but sweet length of ~50 minutes never let me get bored, even in the longer songs. In fact, the longest song which happens to be the title track as well as the closer was an excellent way to end off the album and one of my favourite songs on this album in general. Sorry I've barely said anything about this one, I initially wanted to write loads but the Astro migration has drained all my energy for anything else on my site. Maybe I'll write more later.
