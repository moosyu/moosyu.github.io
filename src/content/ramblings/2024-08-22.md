i tried out arc browser. i didnt really like it, feels more like a gimic browser and the resource usage didnt help. completely unrelated but i wish there were more sites that said intersting things that had an rss feed, my fluent is looking so empty :(

why does youtube keep recommending me these social skills videos. nobody has ever listened to these generic ass videos and actually developed better social skills. you just become a fake impression of someone else. why would an 8 minute video do anything for someone who has bad social skills when like 13 years of school hasnt dumb fuck??
