i just watched [Why The indie-web" by briefs](https://briefs.video/videos/why-the-indie-web/). i thought it was really well done. i dont really think a decentralised web will ever be a thing though (sadly). the web is too big for it to revert to what it was when it had a smaller much more nerdy main audience, also the yesterweb died out because it didnt make fat money stacks and as i watch cohost (sidenote fuck you cohost for suspending me i didnt do anything wrong except criticise you) lose [my hopes](https://cohost.org/staff/post/7045283-june-2024-financial) are not particularly high for non surveillance state advertisement techniques.
