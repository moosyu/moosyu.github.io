confession: half the time i just fill ramblings out ahead of time, im writing this ~15th because i already filled up the previous entries with stuff. sometimes i add multiple thoughts onto the same entry but a filled out calendar lowkey looks nice and for superfluous thoughts like these i really dont think a two day gap is really going to matter at all. maybe if the date is important i wont do this though, in the end i will be feeding this all into an ai to live forever anyway so i dont think i should be too concerned about specifics.
