thinking about having it so if you hover an entry on my ramblings the content of it will appear in a tooltip. obviously itll require some clientside js (unless i want to store it all in a title which sounds like a terrible idea) and im not even sure if people will like that because it will nearly certainly lag and wont even work on phones. i guess ill sit on it.
