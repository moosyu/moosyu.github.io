weird when i see c developers act upset about js/ts being used where it shouldnt be and then go on to say wasm is the future and soon everyone will be making sites with c. you stupid motherfuckers wasm is dogshit and thats just facts. you will waste your time just to make a worse site than if you just made one like a normal person. use web shit to make websites, use c++ to make everything else. thats my truth.
