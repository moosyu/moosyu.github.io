idk why people are so hostile to using javascript (i mean not the programming language, i hate it too but just the concept of it). i feel like these richard stallman ass mfs are purposely choosing not to use new technology (and its not even new isnt it like 20)?!? like should you be flexing you have 10 lines of js in your site? i also see people say that and then turn around and embed someone elses application in their site to play music or something. mf you arent not using javascript youre just adding a few degrees of seperation.
