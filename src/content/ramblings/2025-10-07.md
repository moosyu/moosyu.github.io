im thinking of making the media page more snazzy instead of just a glorified table (or not even glorified as it is now). im thinking of separating all the items out into their own pages like some lower quality mal but just for me and just have the main list be a grid of the names, maybe an image and the ratings and have people click details or something to see my thoughts.
