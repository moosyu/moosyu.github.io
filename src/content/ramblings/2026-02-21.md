title: c++ gripes
---

why is c++ so obese? why are there 200 int types and all of them suck. why are there like 5 ways i can assign a variable and one of then is supposedly the best but also looks ugly? someone should make c- or something where its just c++ that doesnt even try to have any compatibility with c programs, take out all the outdated stuff and keep all the actually good stuff. and also make a proper package manager that isnt dogshit. and also make installing it not some kind of quest. node gets a lot of shit but the fact i can just download it and instantly be able to add packages and run programs is so beautiful. like you can say skill issue but frankly you shouldnt need any skill at all to install something, it should just happen. itd also be lovely if whoever made cout and cin a thing gets beheaded because wow angle brackets are just hideous. the names cout and cin just pain me too, i never get the same glee as when i do a Console.WriteLine or console.log when i use cout. same with scope resolution operators actually because :: just doesnt really do it for me. whoever made the pointer and arrow operators can stay though, i like them. using modules instead of headers is nice at least, shocked that it took until c++20 to make that a thing though. it would be nice however if whoever made this theoretical language also had a time machine to let it marinate for like 30 years thanks.
